This style of preamp is often referred to as 'the sound of Rock n' Roll' for its BIG punchy low end and smooth open top end. The price/performance ratio of the WA-412 is almost unfathomable to the experienced studio engineer who has possibly paid much more for preamps of this style during their career. Featuring fully discrete socketed 6-pin opamps and custom wound Altran USA inputand output transformers, the WA-412 leaves nothing to be desired. If you are looking for multiple channels of world class tone in an affordable package, the WA-412 is the right choice for you. Hook-up Diagrams Inspiration behind the WA-412. When I first started holding regular studio sessions years ago I always desired to have more channels of high-end mic pre's. I could only afford to have one or two in my studio at a time, which was never enough to record a full band or drummer. 'I knew very well that if signals were not recorded well 'on the way in'they wouldn't be salvageable later, but my budget constrained me, so many of thesources were recorded through poor-quality mic pre's. If the WA-412 was available back then I likely wouldn't have had to settle for poor, low-quality tone. The WA-412 was designed 'for the people' (if you will) and we believe it will become a serious work-horse in many professional and homestudios.' - Bryce Young (founder) More f"
