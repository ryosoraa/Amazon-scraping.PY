The DVI-500 indicates voltage from 0.1kV - 500kV on overhead and underground systems - displaying the voltage on a large 3-digit LED display. The DVI displays the voltage and emits an audible alarm when voltage above 100VAC is detected with no range selector switches or settings to be made - just contact the conductor and read the display. This allows the user to determine if the voltage being read is nominal or a lower induced voltage. Built-in universal spline for standard hot stick attachment. Auto shut-off with low battery function. DVI Voltage Detector Tester (PT-DVI, optional) available as a power source to test the DVI before and after use."
