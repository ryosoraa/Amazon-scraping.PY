        "product_descriptions": "HyperDeck Studio 12G gives customers an advanced technology replacement for broadcast decks that were limited to HD only. Customers get the same functionality and control of a traditional broadcast deck but with the advantage of recording directly to 10-bit 4:2:2 uncompressed files for SD and HD, or to broadcast quality Apple ProRes and DNxHD files for SD, HD and Ultra HD. The clarity, sharpness, detail and smooth motion of high frame rate Ultra HD makes it perfect for live sports programming. HyperDeck Studio 12G can be used with the latest broadcast switchers, such as the ATEM Broadcast Studio 12G, to record the master program output. Multiple HyperDecks can even be used to record clean feeds from the switcher, or even ISO recordings from every camera so you have full frame rate 2160p60 video available for instant replays or later post production. HyperDeck Studio 12G features the latest multi rate 12G-SDI and HDMI 2.0 connections, making it compatible with virtually all SD, HD and Ultra HD formats, including high frame rate 2160p60. There are two SSD slots allowing for continuous recording of full 10-bit 4:2:2 quality video onto standard 2.5 solid state disks. When one disk is full recording automatically continues onto the next disk. HyperDeck Studio 12G creates files that are ready for post production and SSD cards can be mounted directly on a Mac or PC computer. That means editors and colorists can instantly use the files off the disk without having to convert or transcode them. Files are compatible with all popular post production applications such as DaVinci Resolve, Final Cut Pro X, Premiere Pro, Media Composer and more. HyperDeck Studio 12G has a compact, single rack unit design that easily fits into any equipment rack, flyaway kit or outside broadcast vehicle. The machined metal design makes it rugged and durable enough to use in even the harshest production environments. The VTR style controls on the front panel are designed to make HyperDeck Studio 12G easy and familiar to use. There are illuminated play, record, rewind, and fast forward buttons, along with a standard jog/shuttle wheel on the front panel. HyperDeck Studio 12G can also be controlled remotely using standard RS-422 deck control or via SDI start/stop triggers."
