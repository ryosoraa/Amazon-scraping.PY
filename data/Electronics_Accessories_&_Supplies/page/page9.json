An additional measuring range with high initial sensitivity of 0.01 lx makes it possible to measure extremely small light intensities. This even permits reliable measurement of emergency lighting. After pressing the HOLD key, the measured value is saved to memory and display illumination included with this version is activated, making it possible to read the display in dark environments. Adaptation to the spectral brightness sensitivity of the human eye V(Lambda) is highly precise with minimal deviation of just f1' Less Than 3 %. Both variants can be used as unclassified luminance meters with the help of an optional luminance attachment with an acceptance angle of 15 deg. . Luminance is measured in candelas per square meter (cd/m2) or footlamberts (fL) and defines the perceived brightness of a back-lighted or reflecting surface. At GOSSEN, great emphasis is placed upon reliability by means of calibration. For purposes of documented evidence, a factory calibration certificate or a DAkkS calibration certificate can be ordered along with either variant. Depending on how the meter is used, we recommend a calibration interval of 12 to 24 months. Maximum Precision Classified measurement of illuminance in lx or fc in accordance with class B or class C per DIN 5032-7, appendi"
