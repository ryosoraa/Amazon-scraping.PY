The capsule of the TLM 193 is the same legendary large diaphragm capsule used in the U89i/TLM170 family. This unit is mated to the proven FET100 circuitry of the KM100 series. Offering state-of-the-art specifications and performance in a value-conscious package, the TLM193 is without peer: Ultra-low self noise (10dB-A), high sound-pressure capability (140dB before overload), dynamic range (130dB), wide frequency response (20Hz - 20kHz) and the quality, durability, longevity, and glorious sound which has earned Neumann its reputation. The TLM193 is the perfect microphone for both budget-conscious project studios and larger facilities who want Neumann performance without paying for the additional features of their flagship models. It excels at many applications including overhead and close-miking drums, capturing the nuances of acoustic performances, and recording critical vocals in the Neumann tradition.The TLM193 package includes the microphone, a swivel-mount stand adapter, and a foam-lined wooden jeweler's case.Acoustical Operating Principal: Pressure gradient transducer Directional Patterns: Cardioid Frequency Range: 20 to 20,000 Hz Sensitivity: 11 mV/Pa \u00b11 dB Rated Impedance: 50 ohms Rated Load Impedance: 1000 ohms Equivalent Loudness Level Due To Inherent Noise: (CCIR 468-3 weighted) 21dB (DI..."
