This unit provides the silky, vintage warmth of the original console's mic amp design, and will flatter any microphone or instrument with its signature sound. Thanks to its convenient form factor, the SOLO/610 can be used in the control room or the recording room, on stage, or on a desktop. Functionally lean but sonically mean, the SOLO/610 maintains the character of the 610 console - at a price every serious project studio can afford. The SOLO/610 offers Mic and DI inputs, and features Gain and Level control for a wide variety of clean to colored tones. Unlike its predecessors, the SOLO/610 has continuous Gain control with even greater range, allowing for more precise gain structuring - doubling as input signal padding. The SOLO/610 has all the essential features like 48v Phantom Power, Lo-Cut filtering, Phase Reverse and flexible dual impedance selection for both Mic and DI inputs. The SOLO/610 includes essential DI features like Thru (for use with an amplifier), as well as Ground Lift and Mic/Line level output switches."
