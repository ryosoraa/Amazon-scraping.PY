The front and second elements are fluorite (a lightweight mono-crystal optical material), which provides superior optical characteristics and reduced weight for balanced handling. Two extra-low dispersion (ED) glass elements provide superior  A marvel of optical design: the groundbreaking 800mm prime.Introducing one of the most impressive feats of NIKKOR engineering yetthe remarkable full frame AF-S NIKKOR 800mm f/5.6E FL ED VR. Offering sports, news and wildlife photographers the pinnacle of reach and performance, it combines advanced NIKKOR optics and lens technology within a dust- and water-resistant magnesium-alloy body. With Nikon's exclusive Silent Wave Motor (SWM) providing ultra-fast, ultra-quiet autofocusing, lightweight fluorite lens elements improving optical performance and handling, Vibration Reduction enabling faster handheld shooting* and an electromagnetic diaphragm for consistent exposures during high-speed bursts, the AF-S NIKKOR 800mm f/5.6E FL ED VR sets a new standard for super-telephoto lenses. And with the included AF-S Teleconverter TC800-1.25E ED, you can increase overall focal length to a whopping 1000mm (1500mm equivalent on DX-format cameras). Conquer distance like never before. *Based on CIPA Standard As the longest lens in the NIKKOR lineup, the AF-S NIKKOR 800mm f/5.6E FL ED VR delivers an astounding 800mm (1200mm equivalent on DX-format cameras) of super-telephoto reach with a fast f/5.6 maximum aperture in a rugged, well-balanced design. But for even greater reach, the lens includes a matched 1.25x teleconverter (TC 800-1.25E). This high-performance 1.25x teleconverter has an Extra-low Dispersion (ED) glass element for superior sharpness and color correction, and it increases the lens' overall focal length to 1000mm (1500mm equivalent on DX-format cameras). The AF-S NIKKOR 800mm f/5.6E FL ED VR is a marvel of NIKKOR optical design. The lens is comprised of 20 elements split into 13 lens groups. The front and second elements are fluorite (a lightweight mono-crystal optical material), which provides superior optical characteristics and reduced weight for balanced handling. Two Extra-low Dispersion (ED) glass elements provide superior sharpness and color correction by minimizing chromatic aberration, and Nano Crystal Coat (N) reduces ghosting and lens flare throughout the visible spectrum. The AF-S NIKKOR 800mm f/5.6E FL ED VR is an advanced lens for advanced D-SLRs. Autofocus is powered by Nikon's exclusive Silent Wave Motor (SWM), which uses ultrasonic vibrationsinstead of a gear systemfor ultra-fast, ultra-quiet, ultra-precise focusing. It also allows you to seamlessly override the AF system with no time lag. Nikon's second generation Vibration Reduction enables handheld shooting at up to 4 shutter speeds slower than would otherwise be possible (Based on CIPA Standard)a huge advantage when the lighting is less than ideal. And for maintaining consistent exposures during high-speed continuous shooting, the lens uses a highly precise 9-blade electromagnetic diaphragm that produces outstanding bokeh under the shallow depth-of-field necessary for separating subjects from the background during peak action photography."

This version of the scope is outfitted with a modified duplex ranging reticle with 0.5 MRAD indicators and stadia to assist in range and target size estimation as well as ballistic drop compensation for long-distance shots. Running on one CR123 battery with an exceptionally long runtime, the reticle is illuminated in red with 15 intensities: 10 for daytime use and 5 for nighttime. The reticle, set on the first focal plane, retains its subtension accuracy at any magnification and can be completely removed from view to allow the scope to be used as a conventional spotter.Optically the STR-80 performs up to Swarovski's high standards and expectations with extra-low dispersion fluoride glass elements that efficiently transmit all wavelengths of visible light, resulting in bright images that are color faithful, crisp, and rich with detail. SWARODUR and SWAROTOP coatings on all lenses and prisms minimize glare while maximizing contrast. The large aperture draws in copious amounts of light, allowing it to be used in the pre-dawn and dusk/twilight hours when animals are most active. This iteration is offered here without an eyepiece for those users who wish to choose one or both of the optional 25-50x wide-angle or 20-60x zoom eyepieces. To make acquiring subjects easy and tracking targets faster, the eyepiece is set in-line with the optical tube for straight-through viewing.Inside The Box:-Swarovski STR-80 HD 80mm Spotting Scope (Straight Viewing, Requires Eyepiece, MRAD Reticle)-CR123 Battery-Objective Lens Cap-Eyepiece Bayonet Mount CapExtra Items From 6Ave:-Swarovski Ocular 25-50X W-Padded Backpack-Flashlight-6FT Tripod-6Ave Cleaning Kit"

Even the most demanding astrophotographers and observers will be thoroughly impressed by this gorgeous telescope.Unlike most ED triplets which feature just one ED glass element, this beautifully crafted apochromatic refractor stands above ordinary triplets by having one element of FPL-53 ED glass and one element of FPL-51 ED glass in its objective lens assembly. With two fluoro-crown ED glass elements and fully multi-coated optics, the Orion EON 104mm ED-X2 refractor provides superior correction of chromatic and spherical aberrations. By suppressing these aberrations so effectively, this triplet 'apo' telescope produces impeccable visual views and razor-sharp astrophotos without any fringing or loss of clarity.The 104mm EON ED-X2 refractor measures 650mm in focal length with a fast f/6.25 focal ratio for great wide-field performance. Multiple internal baffles prevent off-axis reflections for excellent contrast, while a retractable lens shade helps eliminate glare.The EON 104mm ED-X2 sports a big, 2.7 inch hybrid-drive rack and pinion focuser which can support imaging gear trains weighing up to 17.6 lbs., and features dual-speed (11:1) controls to easily fine-tune focus. You can rotate the focuser 360-deg to optimize imaging or observing convenience. The focuser has a built-in focus lock knob to enhance imaging convenience.The Orion EON 104mm ED-X2 f/6.25 Triplet Apo Refractor comes with a thread-on objective lens cover, two heavy-duty machined tube rings, a sturdy machined dovetail bar for easy mount attachment, and a dovetail finder scope base (installation required). An included hard carry case with a custom die-cut foam insert ensures safe transport and convenient storage.Weighing in at 14.6 lbs., the EON 104mm ED-X2 matches well with many medium-size mounts."

With the ability to capture up to 15+ stops of dynamic range, the FX6 is poised to both supplement your FX9 or VENICE capture and to nimbly take on documentary, gimbal, and drone shoots on its own. The FX6 camera combines a 4K full-frame Exmor R sensor with a BIONX XR engine for extremely sensitive capture in a range of settings using a base ISO of 800 as well as an ISO 12800 high-sensitivity mode for nuanced low-light scenes.While the Sony FX6 fits seamlessly into a pro-cine on-set workflow, it also offers several features that are a boon for a single-operator user. These include fast and accurate phase-detection autofocus with both Face Detection and real-time Eye autofocus, both auto and manual ND filter settings for quick exposure compensation, and a 3.5' LCD monitor that boasts timesaving touchscreen access to key menu settings and versatile positioning for comfortable operating."

          "Moving to an even higher resolution realm, the Sony Alpha a7R IV continues the noteworthy series of highly capable full-frame cameras, characterized by impressive stills and video performance and versatility. This fourth edition of the a7R sees the inclusion of an updated 61MP Exmor R BSI CMOS sensor and enhanced BIONZ X image processor, which afford impressive imaging results with marked smoothness, a 15-stop dynamic range, and, of course, speed.",
          "Up to 10 fps shooting is possible along with the ability to record UHD 4K30 video, both with support for Real-time Eye AF and Tracking AF technologies. The revised sensor design uses a Fast Hybrid AF System, with 567 phase-detection autofocus points, for notably fast and accurate focusing performance. Despite being such a high-resolution sensor, it is also distinguished by its flexible native sensitivity range from ISO 100-32000 for working in a variety of lighting conditions.",
          "Balancing the imaging merits, the a7R IV also sees an updated physical design with more robust weather sealing to suit working in especially harsh weather conditions. In terms of usability, the OLED electronic viewfinder has been boosted to an impressive 5.76m-dot resolution for clear viewing and the 3.0' rear tilting touchscreen LCD has a high 1.44m-dot resolution for crisp playback, live view shooting, and menu navigation.",
