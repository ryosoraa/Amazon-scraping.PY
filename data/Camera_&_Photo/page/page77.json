This can largely be attributed to the new camera's high resolution 42.4 MP sensor paired with its large aperture, fixed focal length ZEISS Sonnar T* 35mm F2 lens, which have been fine-tuned to optimize performance together. Additionally, the RX1R II features a 30% improvement in AF response speed compared to the original award-winning RX1 models and is equipped with the world's first optical variable low pass filter that can be set to 'off', 'standard' or 'high' based on user preference, with low pass filter bracketing available. The camera also has a convenient retractable XGA OLED viewfinder for eye-level shooting, which has been implemented with minimal change in overall body size from its predecessors. Ultimate Image Quality in the Palm of Your Hand The RX1R II camera utilizes a back-illuminated 35mm full-frame Exmor R CMOS sensor with approx. 42.4 effective megapixels paired with a powerful BIONZ X processing engine to achieve superior levels of image resolution and sensitivity (ISO 100-25600, expandable to 50 - 1024002) with wide dynamic range. The sensor's back-illuminated structure, with an expanded circuit scale and copper wiring design, enables faster transmission speed and output"

In keeping with its tradition of high-performance optics, Swarovski uses highly reflective roof prisms and fully multicoated fluorite-containing HD glass lenses to deliver superior image quality. A field-flattener lens system complements the glass and coatings to keep the edges of the view crisp and sharp. The resulting views are rich with detail and saturated with lifelike color with exceptional contrast and resolution.In addition to its high-transmission optical system, Swarovski also equips the NL Pure binoculars with a range of design elements that improve the handling experience. A re-engineered bridge and focus system provide smooth movement in a short configuration, so you have more of the optical tubes to grip. Covering the magnesium-alloy housing is Swarovski's iconic rubber armoring that provides impact protection and a positive grip where they are needed most. The housing is nitrogen-filled and O-ring sealed to be resistant to internal fogging and waterproof to a depth of 13 feet. Additional features like tethered front and rear caps, soap and brush cleaning kit, carrying case, and neck strap round out the thoughtful details that make the NL Pure stand out.Manufacturers Items Include:-Swarovski 10x42 NL Pure Binoculars-Cleaning Kit-Neck Strap-Carrying Case-1-Piece Ocular Rainguard-2 x Objective Lens Cover Filler Piece-2 x Objective Lens Connector-2 x Objective Lens CapsExtra Items From 6Ave:-Padded Backpack-Flashlight-6Ave Cleaning Kit"

This high-performance lens is part of the S-Line, a newly designated grade of NIKKOR Z lenses that adhere to a new benchmark in optical performance, creating new definitions of design principles and quality control. The NIKKOR Z 24-70mm f/2.8 S demonstrates excellent resolving power that maximizes the potential of high-pixel-count digital cameras like the Z 7, which has an effective pixel count of 45.7 megapixels. Color fringing is significantly minimized with the beautiful, large, natural bokeh unique to the f/2.8 aperture, which makes the lens perfect for shooting highly rendered photographs in a variety of scenes, such as portraits and landscapes, from the maximum aperture of f/2.8. Furthermore, the combination of the larger Z mount with its inner diameter of 55 mm, and a short flange focal distance of 16 mm has allowed the lens to achieve superior optical performance, as well as compactness and lightness for excellent portability. It also offers outstanding movie recording performance with focus breathing control and quiet operation. A multi-focusing system has been adopted as the AF drive system.

The bayonet mount for the eyepiece modules is backward compatible with the original ATX/STX modules, to make it easy for users to upgrade their objectives without needing a new eyepiece module. This larger objective versus the 65mm model draws in more light and produces a larger exit pupil to improve its low-light capabilities and make it an invaluable companion from dawn to dusk.Optically, Swarovski combines the legendary image quality and world-class workmanship that nature enthusiasts, tactical professionals, and researchers have come to expect from the brand. The 85mm objective strikes a nice balance between light-gathering ability and portability, making it well suited for the hunter, outdoor enthusiast, or birder. Extra-low dispersion fluoride glass elements efficiently transmit all wavelengths of visible light, resulting in bright images that are color faithful, crisp, and rich with detail. An integrated field-flattener lens system corrects spherical aberrations to reveal crisp details at the edges of the view without distortion. SWARODUR and SWAROTOP coatings on all lenses and prisms minimize glare while maximizing contrast.Inside The Box:-Swarovski ATX/STX/BTX 85mm Objective Lens ModuleObjective Lens CapRear Bayonet Mount CapExtra Items From 6Ave:-Padded Backpack-Flashlight-6FT Tripod-6Ave Cleaning Kit"

Its bi-color adjustability from 3200K-5600K is great for any light setup. Also, the brightness of the light is consistent across all color temperatures. The beam angle of the light is a wide 110 degrees, making it possible to light a large area with a single fixture. The best thing about a Lyra soft light is the nice clean shadow you get from the light itself. The heavy duty yoke and baby 5/8'/junior 1 1/8' combo pin allow you to attach to any stand or use in any studio configurations. The quick set disk locking system allows professionals to lock the light in place when aiming the fixture. The large yellow knob on the back allows you to control the light with a few simple clicks. You can control the brightness, color temperature, and the DMX Channel, making adjustments as needed. The LED readout gives you the ability to have very precise measurements. The 1 x 2 LED soft panel is an extremely bright soft light that gives the end user the control to light sets or any scene on a stage. These lights are great for any talk show or broadcast new shows."
