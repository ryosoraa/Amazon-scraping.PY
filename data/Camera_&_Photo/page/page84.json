A trio of coatingsAX, eBAND, and BBARhave also been applied to suppress lens flare and ghosting for improved contrast and color rendering when working in bright and backlit conditions.Benefitting the optical assets, performance and handling is enhanced through the use of dual MPUs (Micro-Processing Unit), which ensure fast and reliable image stabilization and autofocus. Vibration Compensation accounts for up to 4.5 stops of camera shake, to result in sharper images when shooting handheld at slower shutter speeds. Conversely, a USD motor provides quick and quiet autofocus performance as well as full-time manual focus override. Additionally, the lens body is weather-sealed and moisture resistant, and the front element features a protective fluorine coating to guard against dust and smearing.Manufacturer Included Items:Tamron SP 15-30mm f/2.8 Di VC USD G2 Lens for Nikon FFront Lens CapSP Rear Lens Cap for Nikon F-Mount LensesBundle Items Include:1 x Tamron SP 15-30mm f/2.8 Di VC USD G2 Lens for Nikon F1 x Padded Lens Case1 x Table Top Tripod, Lens Cleaning Kit, LCD Protector1 x High Quality Dust Blower1 x Lens Pen Cleaner1 x Microfiber Cloth"

The Classical Cassegrain design hasn't gotten much play among amateur astronomers because they haven't been available except in very large sizes at very high prices. But all that is about to change. Our 8' f/12 Classical Cassegrain excels for high-resolution lunar and planetary viewing and imaging, and will get you in close on tight deep-sky objects such as globular clusters and planetary nebulas. It's a compelling offering for those wanting serious magnifying capability in a compact form factor. With an optional 10mm eyepiece you're already probing at 240x magnification! The Classical Cassegrain optical design utilizes a parabolic primary mirror and a hyperbolic secondary mirror, which for the CC8 allow a long, 'folded' focal length of 2400mm in a tube just 25' long and weighing under 19 lbs. That means the CC8 is easily supported on a modest-size mount like the Orion Atlas Pro. Both mirrors are made from thermally stable quartz, with enhanced aluminum coating delivering 96% reflectivity. The 200mm primary mirror is fixed in place so you won't get image shift or mirror flop as from a typical Schmidt-Cassegrain or Maksutov. Focusing is done with a 2' dual-speed (10:1) linear bearing Crayford focuser, which is incredibly rigid under heavy loads. Moreover, the CC8 has no glass on the front end to dew up. It's an open tube with 11 baffles inside to ensure maximum contrast. Sold as optical tube assembly, the CC8 comes with TWO dovetail finder scope bases, a wide D plate mounting bar on the bottom and slotted V-style mounting bar on top, and three extension rings to allow focus with different visual or imaging combos. Backfocus from the 2' accessory collar is 166mm. If the idea of a long focal length telescope for high-power visual pursuits or for lunar or planetary photography sounds like fun, get your hands on the Orion CC8 8' Classical Cassegrain telescope today!"

Complementing the flexible wide-angle design is a sophisticated optical layout that utilizes a pair of aspherical elements and three low dispersion elements to reduce spherical and chromatic aberrations throughout the zoom range in order to realize a high degree of sharpness, clarity, and color accuracy. Multi-layer coatings have also been applied to limit flare and ghosting for increased contrast when working in strong lighting conditions. Benefiting the optical assets is a stepping motor, which delivers fast and quiet autofocus performance, and a floating elements system maintains consistent imaging quality throughout the focusing range. Additionally, an AquaDura coating has been applied to the exposed elements and seals have been incorporated in the lens design to benefit working in harsh environmental conditions."

        "product_descriptions": "Sony System 16-35mmF2.8 ZA SSM Get dramatic landscapes and interiors with the unique SAL1635Z. This Carl Zeiss lens is a super-wide angle 16-35mm zoom. And it's a super-fast f2/8. Thanks to Sony's SteadyShot in-camera stabilization, this is the world's only large-aperture, full-frame-capable, wide-angle zoom with the benefit of image stabilization (as of Sept. 2008). When changing your aperture to defocus the background, the light sources appear blurred. This \u2018bokeh' effect of the blurred background can be enhanced with circular aperture blades used in this lens. Conventional aperture blades have flat sides creating unappealing polygonal shaped defocussed points of light.  lenses overcome this problem through a unique design that keeps the aperture almost perfectly circular from its wide-open setting to when it is closed by 2 stops. Smoother, more natural defocusing can be obtained as a result. As focal lengths get longer, lenses built with conventional optical glass have difficulties with chromatic aberration, and as a result images suffer from lower contrast, lower color quality, and lower resolution. ED glass dramatically reduces chromatic aberration at telephoto ranges, and provides superior contrast across the entire image, even at large aperture settings. Super ED glass provides enhanced compensation for chromatic aberration. Aspherical lens design dramatically reduces spherical aberration while also reducing lens size and weight. Spherical aberration is a slight misalignment of the light rays projected on the image plane. This is caused by differences in refraction at different points on conventional spherical lenses which degrade image quality in large-aperture lenses. Specially shaped aspherical elements near the diaphragm restore alignment of light rays at the image plane, maintaining high sharpness and contrast even at maximum aperture and can also be used at other points in the optical path to reduce distortion. Well-designed aspherical elements can reduce the total number of elements required in the lens, thus reducing overall size and weight. Advanced Aspherical (AA) elements are an evolved variant, featuring an extremely high thickness ratio between the center and periphery. AA elements are exceedingly difficult to produce, relying on the most advanced molding technology to consistently and precisely achieve the required shape and surface accuracy, resulting in significantly improved image accuracy and quality. Coated optics were pioneered by Carl Zeiss - and this superb lens features the Carl Zeiss T* (T-Star) coating that virtually eliminates lens flare, internal reflection and light scattering that can otherwise occur at glass-to-air surfaces. The T* coating contributes to outstanding image quality, with high contrast and uniformly excellent resolution right out to the image edges. Not simply applied to any lens - the T* symbol only appears on multi-element lenses in which the required performance has been achieved throughout the entire optical path, therefore guaranteeing the highest quality. Once you've adjusted focus to where you want it, pressing this button on the lens barrel will keep the lens locked to that focusing distance. The preview function can also be assigned to this button through the camera's custom settings. The distance encoder plays an integral part in ADI flash metering, which delivers high precision flash metering that is unaffected by the reflectance of subjects or backgrounds. The distance encoder is a lens component that directly detects the position of the focusing mechanism, and sends a signal to the CPU in order to measure distance to the subject. During flash photography, this data is very useful in calculating how much flash output is appropriate to the scene. Only the middle groups of the optical system move to achieve focus, so the overall length of the lens does not change. Other important benefits include fast autofocusing and a short minimum focusing distance. Also, the filter thread at the front of the lens does not rotate, which is convenient if you're using a polarizing filter. SSM is a piezoelectric motor that contributes to smooth and silent AF operation. The motor produces high torque at slow rotation, and provides immediate start and stop responses. It is also extremely quiet, which helps keep autofocusing silent. Lenses that feature SSM also include a position-sensitive detector to directly detect the amount of lens rotation, a factor that improves AF precision overall. 2008 Sony Electronics, Inc.

        "product_descriptions": "The AmScope PZ200BB compound polarizing microscope has a Siedentopf binocular mount with interchangeable pairs of 10x widefield and 20x widefield eyepieces, a focusable Bertrand lens on a rotatable disc, a forward-facing nosepiece with three DIN strain-free plan achromatic objectives, polarizing and Brightfield halogen illumination, and a round graduated stage with a stage stop to protect slides and objectives from damage. The Siedentopf binocular mount has interchangeable pairs of WF10x and WF20x eyepieces with 55 to 75mm interpupillary adjustment, a fixed 45-degree vertical inclination to reduce eye and neck strain, and a 360-degree rotation capability to enable sharing. A Siedentopf binocular head enables the viewer to change the interpupillary distance without changing the tube length, eliminating the need to re-focus the image. Dioptric adjustment accommodates individual eye-strength differences. The forward-facing, ball-bearing driven triple nosepiece has 4x, 10x, and 40xS (spring) DIN strain-free plan achromatic objectives. Strain-free objectives are optimized for use with polarized light, and plan achromatic objectives provide color correction and focus over the entire viewing field. The 40xS objective is spring loaded to prevent slide damage when focusing. Polarizing microscopes are used in geology, petrology, mineralogy, toxicology, pharmacology, forensics, and industrial inspection applications to view and measure birefringence of anisotropic materials, including organic compounds, water, minerals, and rocks. The microscope has polarizing and Brightfield illumination with a selection knob to choose between illumination types. The built-in Bertrand lens has a rotating disc with centering controls, and 90-degree rotation with 1-degree graduations. The polarizer, analyzer, and Bertrand lens can be removed from the optical path to use the microscope as a Brightfield microscope. Transmitted 20W halogen illumination has a rheostat to control light intensity, and provides bright light in a concentrated path. The 1.25 NA Abbe condenser is mounted on a steel rack-and-pinion control system and can be adjusted to control the distance of the light from the stage. An iris diaphragm optimizes the amount of light illuminating the specimen. The round 160mm diameter floating stage has 360-degree rotation on a ball-bearing movement, and a 28mm vertical travel range. The stage is graduated in 1-degree increments and is equipped with a vernier scale for greater precision, which allows retardation measurements to be made with a minimum resolution of 6 minutes of arc. It has a locking screw to secure the stage location, detachable slide clips, and a stain-resistant finish. Nested coaxial coarse and fine focus has tension-adjustable coarse focusing and an adjustable lock ring stopper that limits stage range to protect slides and objectives from damage. All-metal mechanical parts, solid-metal frame construction, and a stain-resistant enamel finish provide durability. Microscopes are instruments used to enhance the resolution of an object or image. Types include compound, stereo, or digital. Compound microscopes use a compound optical system with an objective lens and an eyepiece. Stereo microscopes show object depth in a three-dimensional image. Digital microscopes are used to display an image on a monitor, rather than looking through a lens. Microscopes can have monocular (one), binocular (two), or trinocular (three) eyepieces, with varying magnification abilities. Magnification ability refers to the size of an image. Resolution, also known as resolvant power, refers to the clarity of the image. The interaction between field of view (FOV), numerical aperture (NA), and working distance (WD) determines resolution. Microscopes can control magnification through a fixed focus, or through a range of adjustments. They can also utilize LED, fluorescent, and mirror light sources to help control viewing capabilities. Microscopes are widely used in education, lab research, biology, metallurgy, engineering, chemistry, manufacturing, and in the medical, forensic science, and veterinary industries. United Scope manufactures microscopy equipment and accessories under the brand name AmScope. The company, founded in 1996, is headquartered in Irvine, CA."
