This allows you to take shots that are as realistic as possible, and it makes color-correcting your images easier in post-production. In addition, Catta lenses promise to produce vivid and natural skin tones.Parfocal Design.With a parfocal optical design, the DZOFILM Catta Zoom lenses feature reduced focus breathing. As a result, unlike still photography lenses, the focus remains constant when the focal length changes, allowing for zoom racking without losing focus. To set up a shot, you can zoom in as far as you like and set a focus. The image will remain sharp as you zoom out to your desired framing.Geared Rings, T Stops.Each cinema lens has an aperture range of T2.9 to T22. DZOFILM uses a 16-blade aperture diaphragm for smooth and round bokeh. The minimum focus distance is around 2.5 feet, so you can get some great close-ups with an attractive blurred background. With 270 degrees of travel, the geared focus ring ensures smooth and precise focusing and zooming.Lightweight Build.DZOFILM Catta Zoom lenses measure around 7 inches long for the PL mount and around 7.4 inches long for the EF mount.

The smaller objectives reduce the overall size and weight for better portability and less muscle strain during long-duration viewing sessions, while still delivering competent low-light performance. Helping to compensate for the distracting hand shake common with using 10x and greater optics, is a wide 67? apparent viewing angle. This allows the use of high-magnification binoculars without the need for stabilization equipment such as harnesses.Manufacturer Included Items:Leica 10x32 Ultravid HD-Plus BinocularsCordura Nylon CaseContoured Neoprene Strap2 x Eyepiece Caps2 x Objective Lens CapsBundle Items Include:1 x Leica 10x32 Ultravid HD-Plus Binoculars1 x Pro Sling Backpack1 x 72-Inch Full Size Pro Monopod1 x Deluxe Cleaning Set2 x Lens Cap Keeper1 x Neck Strap"
