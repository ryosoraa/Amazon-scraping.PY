Furthermore, it has a 13MP camera that gives an easy way to prove delivery or shipment issues. Ultra-Durable: Design for harsh environments, HT730 features ultra-durable design to withstand 1.8m / 2.4m (with bumper) drop to concrete and IP65 / IP67 environmental seal against water and dust. Moreover, the HT730 offers options including a rugged gun grip, a rugged UHF RFID long-range reader, and even a rugged extra-long-range barcode scan engine that enhances the ease of use and increases staff comfort for inventory tracking and taking solutions. Optical Character Recognition (OCR) : HT730 provides Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology in Unitech USS software to streamline your tedious typing process and minimize the typing mistakes when entering the numbers. Our OCR technology allows users to easily convert numbers or characters to digital formats on cardboards, paperwork, electronic chips, and any other readable surface. SmartPA: Better Audio Output: SmartPA(Power Amplifier) takes full advantage of the relatively smaller speaker to enhance better sound quality with maximum volume. Under distracted scenarios or noisy environments, outdoor workers access messages through a clearer, more natural, and high-quality audio experience while speaking on the mobile computer. The built-in SmartPA solution detects the current and voltage in speaker mode and minimizes circuit/ temperature damage, providing seamless communication between coworkers to achieve productivity."

It is designed and developed for professional field shooting. Comprising 22 elements in 17 groups, the use of 2 UED (Ultra Extra-low Dispersion) lenses, 3 ED (Extra-low Dispersion) lenses and optimum alignment effectively suppresses both axial chromatic aberration and chromatic aberration of magnification. Astigmatism is also corrected with an aspherical lens, achieving high resolving performance. Adoption of a double focus system suppresses fluctuation of aberration even at close distances, which results in high descriptive performance from the center to the corners over the entire zoom range despite its large aperture. Covering from 70mm to 200mm by itself, the use of a Teleconverter allows maximum 280mm (1.4x, with DMW-STC14) and 400mm (2x, with DMW-STC20) super telephoto shooting*1, with maximum 480 fps focus control for high-speed, high-precision auto focus. The O.I.S. (Optical Image Stabilizer) in the lens complies with the camera's Body I.S. and the 5-Axis Dual I.S. makes it possible to use a 7-stop slower shutter speed. Adoption of a focus clutch mechanism enables instant AF/MF switching and accurate manual focusing. The constant F2.8 large aperture provides smooth defocus gradation from the focus peak to the neighboring area of the image to achieve a beautiful bokeh effect as well as"
