Revolving around a redeveloped 24.2MP Exmor CMOS sensor and BIONZ X image processor, clean image quality is provided with a wide expandable sensitivity range to ISO 51200, along with accelerated readout speeds for internal 4K30 and Full HD 1080p120 video recording with full pixel readout. Stills shooters also benefit from the apt processing speed, which enables continuous shooting at 11 fps for up to 21 raw frames in a burst, as well as 14-bit raw file output. Complementing both stills and video, the sensor and processor combination also avails 4D FOCUS, which combines a wide-coverage 425-point phase-detection system with a 169-area contrast detection system for quick and precise focusing performance. This focusing system also enables High-density Tracking AF for more efficient and accurate tracking of moving subjects across the image frame. A well-rounded camera for both photographers and videographers.In The Box:Sony Alpha a6300 Mirrorless Digital Camera with 16-50mm Lens (Black)E PZ 16-50mm f/3.5-5.6 OSS LensNP-FW50 Lithium-Ion Rechargeable Battery (1020mAh)Shoulder StrapAccessory Shoe CapEyepiece CupMicro-USB CableBundle Items:1 x Sony Alpha a6300 Mirrorless Digital Camera with 16-50mm Lens1 x SanDisk 64GB Extreme PRO UHS-I SDXC Memory Card1 x Soft Padded Carrying Case1 x NP-FW50 Replacement Lithium-Ion Battery1 x Lens Cleaning Solution1 x Blower Brush1 x Microfiber Cloth1 x Lens Tissue Paper1 x 5pc Cotton Swabs1 x High Quality Dust Cleaner Blower1 x Lens Pen Cleaner1 x SD Card USB Reader1 x Lens Cap Keeper1 x Microfiber Cloth"

A sophisticated optical design with two extra refractive elements, three low dispersion elements, three glass-molded aspherical elements, and one hybrid aspherical element helps to suppress aberrations and distortion throughout the zoom range while eBAND and BBAR coatings have been applied to individual elements to control lens flare and ghosting for improved contrast and color fidelity. Balancing its optical attributes, this lens also utilizes a USM autofocus motor to deliver notably quick, quiet, and precise focusing performance that suits both stills and video applications. Also, 5-stop-effective Vibration Compensation helps to minimize the appearance of camera shake for sharper handheld shooting in difficult lighting conditions. Additionally, the lens is moisture-resistant and has a fluorine coating on the front element to enable its use in trying environmental conditions.Manufacturer Included Items:Tamron SP 24-70mm f/2.8 Di VC USD G2 Lens for Nikon F82mm Snap-On Lens CapSP Rear Lens Cap for Nikon F-Mount LensesLens HoodBundle Items Include:1 x Tamron SP 24-70mm f/2.8 Di VC USD G2 Lens for Nikon F1 x Padded Lens Case1 x Table Top Tripod, Lens Cleaning Kit, LCD Protector1 x High Quality Dust Blower1 x Lens Pen Cleaner1 x Microfiber Cloth"
