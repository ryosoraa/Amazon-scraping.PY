An innovative 4-part fluoride lens objective for maximum color fidelity and richness of contrast. Optically neutral front lens glass to protect the APO optic and Leica AquaDura coating. Particularly short close focus distance of 3.9 meters. Rubber-protected magnesium housing, waterproofed up to 5 meters. It's the perfect tool for experiencing nature at very close range. High-quality images can be captured with a camera using photo or digital adapters. The innovative Leica AquaDura coating considerably reduces these disturbing factors. As with the lotus plant, this new water and dirt-resistant protective layer on the outer glass surfaces ensures that dirt and moisture are barely able to take hold on the specially adapted surface structure of the optic. There are two options: with 25x  50x WW ASPH eyepiece and without eyepiece."
