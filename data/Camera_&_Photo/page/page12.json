You can count on excellent overviews and detailed coverage thanks to the brilliant design of this cost-effective solution. Wide area surveillance with high-quality overview-24/7 AXIS P3727-PLE offers four channels with 2 MP per channel at 30 fps letting you capture both wide-angle and zoomed-in, detailed views. It includes day/night functionality and 360 IR illumination with individually controllable LEDs and an automatic IR cut filter. So, you'll enjoy clear, reflection-free footage and excellent image quality even in low light or complete darkness as well as undistorted colors during the day. Thanks to Forensic WDR it ensures clarity when there's both dark and light areas in the scene. Furthermore, it's possible to run AXIS Object Analytics on one of the four channels allowing you to detect and classify people and vehicles entering a user-defined area or crossing a user-defined virtual line. Brilliant Design This compact, flexible multidirectional camera offers various mounting options. For instance, it can be recessed mounted for discreet surveillance or mounted in ceilings for complete 360 coverage. When mounted on corners, it offers 270 coverage. With a tamper-resistance casing and integrated IP66/IP67 rated weather shield that protects against rain, snow, and sunlight, AXIS P3727-PLE is ideal for outdoor wall mounting. It allows for flexible positioning of all four varifocal camera heads so they can be moved and rotated to provide the optimal field of view. And, each head can be controlled individually so you can monitor scenes in four directions. The camera's sensors can also be twisted, allowing two camera heads to be positioned closer together, so one can take the wide view and the other can zoom in on the same target. Cost-efficient and secure With four camera heads in one camera, AXIS P3727-PLE offers fast, accurate, and cost-effective installation. That's because there's only one camera to install, one cable to draw, and one IP address, one video management software (VMS) license, and just one license for any analytics you choose to install. Plus, remote zoom and focus capabilities eliminate the need for hands-on fine tuning. And, with snap-fit installation, the casing simply snaps on. AXIS P3727-PLE offers enhanced security functionality to prevent unauthorized access and safeguard your system."

H-x1025 is built for mirrorless Micro Four Thirds mount cameras and enables F1. 7 aperture brightness throughout the entire 20-50mm (35mm camera equivalent) zoom range with exceptionally high optical performance clearing the stringent Leica standards. Suitable not only for photo shooting but also for video recording to satisfy both professional photographers and videographers. Comprising 17 elements in 12 groups, the lens system features three aspherical lenses and four ED (extra-low dispersion) lenses that effectively suppress the axial chromatic aberration and chromatic aberration of magnification. Spherical aberration and distortion are also corrected by the aspherical lenses for stunningly high resolution. The use of aspherical lenses and the optimum design of the lens system results in a compact size and light weight despite its outstanding optical performance. Compatibility with a maximum 240-fps high-speed sensor drive realizes high-speed, high-precision auto focusing. Notably, the new lens excels in video recording performance. In addition to the silent operation achieved by the inner focus drive system, The StepLess de-cliked aperture ring and micro-step drive system in the aperture control section help the camera to smoothly catch up to brightness changes When zooming or panning. The optical design achieves exceptional barycentric stability to minimize image shifts during zooming. Adoption of a focus Clutch Mechanism enables instant AF/MF switching and accurate manual focusing. The lens also excels in video recording performance with a mechanism that suppresses focus breathing, which was a fatal problem of all interchangeable lenses designed for still image photography."

Question: What is the input lag of the projector? Answer: The input lag is 49ms. Question: Does the projector support 1080p 120Hz? Answer: No, does not support 1080p 120Hz. Question: Does the projector support HDR? Answer: No, the projector does not support HDR. Question: Does the projector support 3D? Answer: Yes. 1080p 3D content is supported in Top/Bottom, Side by Side, Sequential (PC) and Frame Pack (Blu-ray). Question: Where can I buy 3D DLP Link Glasses? Answer: Compatible 3D DLP Link Glasses can be purchased directly from Amazon from brands such as APEMAN and Boblov."
