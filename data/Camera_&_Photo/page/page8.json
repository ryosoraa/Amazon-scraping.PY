          "ULTIMATE RESOLUTION, DEPENDABLE PROCESSING: Powered by Fujifilm's high-performance X-Processor 4 quad-core CPU, GFX100S utilizes its 102MP, back-illuminated large format CMOS sensor to create truly stunning results. Create remarkably detailed still images that possess amazing color fidelity, and rich shadow detail, with enough dynamic range to allow for astonishing push and pull adjustments in post-production. Or, use Pixel Shift Multi-Shot to create ultra-high resolution 400MP stills with remarkable detail. In video mode, record 4K/30p footage in 10-bit F-log or 12-bit ProRes RAW, with an incredibly beautiful depth of field, for a look that is made for the silver-screen.",
          "SMALL, BUT STEADY: Sitting at the heart of GFX100S is a newly developed shutter and In-Body Image Stabilization (IBIS) system that helps ensure you always make the most of the extreme resolution of the camera's 102MP imaging sensor. While reduced in size, compared to their counterparts in GFX100, both elements offer incredible performance, with the new shutter capable of 5fps continuous shooting and the unique, five-axis IBIS now working in conjunction with GF Lens Optical Image Stabilization (OIS) to provide up to 6 stops of correction. With such outstanding performance, GFX100S frees you from a tripod and lets you keep creating even when the light is low.",
          "THE SHARP END OF AF TECHNOLOGY: With an advanced phase detection autofocus (AF) system, GFX100S spearheads a whole new era of large format digital camera systems. An updated autofocus algorithm brings subjects into focus in as quickly as 0.18 sec, even in light levels as low as -5.5EV. This extraordinary performance is strengthened by the presence of phase detect autofocus pixels across nearly 100% of the frame, resulting in complete precision regardless of where the subject is. Combined with responsive tracking and reliable Face/Eye Detection, GFX100S lets large format photographers enjoy reliably accurate AF, even in low-contrast situations.",
          "LARGE FORMAT HAS NEVER FELT LIKE THIS: The GFX system already has a strong reputation for taking high-resolution photography out of the studio and into the world, but GFX100S takes it even further. Not only does it have a super-tough magnesium-alloy casing, but it is also made to operate in temperatures as low as 14F (-10C) and to be dust- and weather-resistant for those off-road moments. At less than 2 pounds (900g), its compact body is comparable in size to many full-frame cameras, but it contains an incredible, 102MP sensor that's almost twice the physical size of the typical full-frame sensor! Simply put, whether you are creating handheld portraits on location, or framing landscapes in the remote wilderness, GFX100S will truly let you harness the extreme power of large format.",
          "ICONIC COLOR MADE FOR YOU: Fujifilm's expertise in color science is legendary among image makers. For more than 86 years, Fujifilm has been responsible for some of the world's most iconic photographs and movies. GFX100S gives you access to this wealth of experience at the touch of a button, powered by one of the world's most widely acclaimed digital color processing engines. With a choice of 19 exclusive FUJIFILM Film Simulation modes, it is easy to achieve fantastic color straight out of camera. With a new FIlm Simulation mode to explore - Nostalgic Neg. - it may just be worth it to spend a little more time here than you originally thought."

          "\u3010The Visual\u3011The Aurora Pro aims to deliver the best out-of-the-box (OOTB) color accuracy with minimal to no professional calibration needed. With four screen options, the projector has been calibrated to a state that can tolerate and account for the variations in projectors themselves, screens, room conditions, calibration tools, and more.",
          "\u3010The Black Level\u3011With ALPD 4.0 RGB+ technology, the Aurora Pro delivers a native contrast ratio of 3000:1. Our dynamic laser dimming technology pushes the black even further, enhancing black levels with minimal impact on color accuracy and other side effects. The dynamic black feature reduces the black level by more than 60% and provides over 30% energy savings, benefiting the environment without compromising your visual experience.",

          "\u3010Fresnel Lens Technology\u3011The prismatic surface of this screen uses the same principles as a Fresnel lens: using concentric half-circles, it directs light from the projector toward the viewer while reducing unwanted light coming from windows and light fixtures. This significantly enhances picture uniformity and contrast. That means NO reflections, NO glare, and NO ghosting!",
          "\u301085% Ambient Light Rejection\u3011 The NexiGo ALR screen effectively blocks 85% of all ambient and ceiling light to provide you with a vibrant, high-contrast display. Never again will you need to draw your curtains to transform your living space into an immersive home theater."
