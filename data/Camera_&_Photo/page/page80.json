        "product_descriptions": "Since launching our first carbon fiber tripods in 2009, we have been dedicated to making the world's finest tripods. With the help of our customers' invaluable feedback, we continuously make improvements. After years of development, we are excited to present our new Mark 2 tripod line!Improved ergonomics make operating the tripod more comfortable and seamless. Additional 1/4'-20 sockets along the outside of the tripod's apex allow you to attach optional accessories and shoulder-strap mounts. The Mark 2 tripod legs are easier to adjust and hold up better to the elements. Redesigned twist-locks prevent grit and debris from contaminating the threads. We added a vent at the top of each leg to allow efficient air transfer when extending or collapsing, for rapid deployment and takedown.What hasn't changed is our attention to detail, high-quality craftsmanship and commitment to proudly make and hand-assemble all our tripods in the USA. The TFC-33 Mk2 has all the features of the TVC-33 but swaps the Versa apex for a fixed apex. The fixed apex cannot be used with accessories like a quick-column but packs smaller in diameter that the TVC-33."

          "VIRTUALLY DISTORTION-FREE OPTICS: Dramatic perspectives and a view from extraordinary image angles - ZEISS lenses open up new composition possibilities. Distortion would disrupt the composition because straight lines, whose image does not go through the image center, would be reproduced with a curved shape. This annoying effect is accordingly and largely compensated through elaborate optical designs at all focal lengths.",
          "EXCELLENT IMAGE QUALITY: ZEISS lenses offer the highest possible standards in terms of performance, reliability and, of course, image quality. Quite simply, they are superior in every way. You can count on highly advanced flare control for crisp and brilliant images, and virtually zero geometric distortion, ensuring precise accuracy when reproducing shapes  especially useful when photographing products and architecture.",
          "EXCELLENT RESOLUTION AND HIGH CONTRAST: Richly saturated and vivid colours are a must in the creation of lasting impressions. However, stray light within an optical system leads to a lightening of the image that is particularly noticeable in the shadows. This reduces image contrast, with the result that exposures lack contrast and appear faded. To avoid this, ZEISS combines various specially developed technologies to reduce the undesirable effects of stray light.",
          "MINIMIZED FOCUS SHIFT: ZEISS T* ZM-mount lenses are specifically designed to minimize focus shift with aperture changes  an important innovation with big benefits for rangefinder photography. As a result, you can expect improved accuracy of the rangefinder-defined focus while the precise 10-blade aperture with 1/3 stop interval click stops ensures exact exposure."
