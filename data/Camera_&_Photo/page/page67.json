          "- Dive 100 meter: Chasing M2 can dive down to 100 meters. Chasing M2 is available as a 100m and 200m variant, but do not misunderstand the designation in the name. It is the same model, but with different lengths of video / data cable. With the 200-meter variant, you have more freedom of movement. Maximum depth is still 100 meters. Video / data cable is interchangeable, and the different lengths can also be purchased separately.0",
          "- 8 Vectored-Thrusters Layout, Omni Movement: M2 has 8 Vectored Thrusters layout which allows OMNI movement in all directions. The aluminum alloy compact body allows single person operation and quick-deployment in 3 minutes.",
          "- 4000 Lumen LED Lights: M2 has two 2000 lumen LED lights (three gears), which can make up for the dimness of deep water and night vision, improve the underwater visual distance and clarity, and highly restore the true underwater color.",
          "- 4K EIS Image Stabilization Camera: M2 offers F1.8 FOV, equipped with 1/2.3 CMOS and EIS anti video-shake feature, which improves the camera's low light performance and dynamic range greatly.",
          "- Standard micro SD card: The included SD card is in the model, but can be removed for easier handling, review and editing of the recordings on eg PC. The included memory card is a standard Micro-SD card with a capacity of 64GB. Here you can alternatively equip the model with Micro-SD memory card of up to 512GB."

Revolving around a redeveloped 24.2MP Exmor CMOS sensor and BIONZ X image processor, clean image quality is provided with a wide expandable sensitivity range to ISO 51200, along with accelerated readout speeds for internal 4K30 and Full HD 1080p120 video recording with full pixel readout. Stills shooters also benefit from the apt processing speed, which enables continuous shooting at 11 fps for up to 21 raw frames in a burst, as well as 14-bit raw file output. Complementing both stills and video, the sensor and processor combination also avails 4D FOCUS, which combines a wide-coverage 425-point phase-detection system with a 169-area contrast detection system for quick and precise focusing performance. This focusing system also enables High-density Tracking AF for more efficient and accurate tracking of moving subjects across the image frame. A well-rounded camera for both photographers and videographers, the a6300 is characterized by its speed and further qualified by its refined image and video quality.In The Box:Sony Alpha a6300 Mirrorless Digital Camera with 16-50mm Lens (Black)E PZ 16-50mm f/3.5-5.6 OSS LensNP-FW50 Lithium-Ion Rechargeable Battery (1020mAh)Shoulder StrapAccessory Shoe CapEyepiece CupMicro-USB CableBundle Items:1 x Sony Alpha a6300 Mirrorless Digital Camera with 16-50mm Lens1 x Lens Cleaning Solution1 x Blower Brush1 x Microfiber Cloth1 x Lens Tissue Paper1 x 5pc Cotton Swabs1 x High Quality Dust Cleaner Blower1 x Lens Pen Cleaner1 x Lens Cap Keeper1 x Microfiber Cloth"

A Super Multi-Layer Coating also enhances image quality by suppressing lens flare and ghosting for improved contrast and color fidelity in strong lighting conditions. Additionally, making it an ideal lens for portraiture, the bright f/1.8 maximum aperture pairs with a rounded nine-blade diaphragm to benefit selective focus and shallow depth of field imaging with smooth bokeh.Manufacturer Included Items:Sigma 135mm f/1.8 DG HSM Art Lens for Sony ESigma LCF-82 III 82mm Lens CapSigma Rear Cap LCR II for Sony E Mount LensesLH880?-03 Lens HoodLens CaseBundle Items Include:1 x Sigma 135mm f/1.8 DG HSM Art Lens for Sony E1 x Pro Sling Backpack1 x SanDisk 64GB Ultra SDXC Memory Card1 x Premium Lens Case1 x Memory Card Reader1 x 3 Piece Pro Filter Kit UV, CPL, and FLD1 x Deluxe Cleaning Set1 x 12 Inch Flexible Tripod1 x Memory Card Wallet1 x Wireless Remote Shutter Release1 x Lens Cap Keeper"

It's characterized by its newly developed sensor, advanced AF performance, and high-resolution 8K video recording. The core of the Z 9 is the newly developed FX-format 45.7MP BSI stacked CMOS sensor. Its stacked design offers fast readout speeds and helps to reduce rolling shutter, and the BSI design contributes to impressive clarity and minimal noise. At 45.7MP, it's also a high-resolution chip that benefits landscape, portraiture, and video recording. The full-frame BSI design offers a native ISO 64-25600 range, that can be expanded to ISO 32-102400.An advanced processing engine, the EXPEED 7, offers speeds approximately 10x faster than a Z 7II. This engine works in conjunction with the stacked sensor design to realize impressively fast AF speeds, burst shooting rates, a high buffer capacity, and fluid video performance. The Z 9 uses just an electronic shutter for all capture modes. The speed of the sensor enables recording at up to 1/32,000 sec and the stacked structure reduces motion distortion for accurate depiction of fast-moving subjects.Manufacturer Included Items:1 x EN-EL18d Lithium-Ion Battery1 x MH-33 Li-Ion Battery Charger1 x BL-7 Battery Chamber Cover1 x EH-7P Charging AC Adapter1 x AN-DC24 Padded Strap1 x UC-E24 USB-C CableThis Nikon Bundle Contains:1 x Nikon Z 9 FX-Format Mirrorless Camera (Body)1 x Nikon NIKKOR Z 24-70mm f/2.8 S Lens (20089)1 x Sony Pro 32GB XQD G Series Memory Card1 x Corel Photo Editing Essentials Software1 x Large Padded Camera Gadget Case1 x 4-Piece Close-Up Macro Filter Kit1 x 3-Piece Filter Kit (UV, CPL, FLD)1 x Professional UV Lens Filter1 x 12' Flexible Mini-Tripod1 x Padded Hand Grip Strap1 x Lens Cap Keeper Strap1 x Deluxe Lens Cleaning Kit"
