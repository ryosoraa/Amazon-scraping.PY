The Advanced VX 8\u00e2\u0080\u009d Newtonian telescope is an excellent entry- to mid-level setup that can grow with you. The Newtonian optical design is excellent for visual observing and offers you the largest aperture for the price. The parabolic primary mirror minimizes spherical aberration to produce a sharper image near the edge of the field of view.\u00c2 The 8\u00e2\u0080\u009d Newtonian optical tube offers 78% more light gathering ability than the 6\u00e2\u0080\u009d Newtonian optical tube. The Advanced VX mount is designed to provide superior performance for smaller telescopes while taking advantage of Celestron\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most advanced technologies: All-Star Polar Alignment, Celestron PWI telescope control software, SkyAlign, and permanently programmable periodic error correction (PPEC). If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re an experienced imager, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll love taking this portable mount to a dark sky site and enjoying all the conveniences of a larger observatory mount. Or, if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re new to imaging, Advanced VX will help you get started with the hobby and keep up with your needs for years to come. Computerized German equatorial mount The Advanced VX is the smallest of Celestron\u00e2\u0080\u0099s German equatorial mounts. The computerized GoTo capability automatically tracks objects as they move across the night sky.
