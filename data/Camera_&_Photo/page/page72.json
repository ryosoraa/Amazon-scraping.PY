Featuring a 24.3MP CMOS sensor, along with the EXPEED 4 image processor, this camera is capable of producing high-resolution imagery and sensitivity to an expandable ISO 51200, at a continuous shooting rate of up to 6.5 fps. In regard to video recording, Full HD 1080p/60 is supported. Working from different angles is possible due to the tilting 3.2' 1,229k-dot LCD monitor. The D750 also features built-in Wi-Fi connectivity for remote shooting. An equally apt 51-point AF system, with 15 cross-type points can be configured to utilize five AF points as a single focusing point. The 3D Color Matrix Metering III system, along with the 91,000-pixel RGB sensor, provides accurate exposure metering to suit a vast array of subjects and lighting conditions. The D750 supports in-camera creation of time-lapse movies with automated exposure smoothing, and a range of Picture Control profiles can be applied to refine the color and tonal handling of imagery.Manufacturer Included Items:1 x Nikon EN-EL15 Lithium-Ion Battery1 x Nikon MH-25A Battery Charger1 x Nikon AN-DC14 Camera Strap1 x Nikon DK-21 Rubber Eyecup1 x Nikon BF-1B Body CapTHIS NIKON INTERNATIONAL CAMERA BUNDLE CONTAINS:1 x Nikon D750 DSLR Digital Camera Kit Package1 x Nikon AF NIKKOR 50mm f/1.8D FX Lens1 x SanDisk 64GB Ultra SDHC SD Memory Card1 x EN-EL15 Compatible Lithium-Ion Battery1 x Large Digital SLR Camera Gadget Bag1 x 52mm Professional Telephoto Lens1 x 52mm to 58mm Step-Up Ring1 x 52mm Professional UV Filter1 x 52mm 3-Piece Pro Filter Kit1 x 52mm Tulip Lens Hood1 x Lens Cap Keeper Strap1 x USB SD Card Reader1 x Memory Card Wallet1 x Deluxe Cleaning Kit"

The Advanced VX 6\u00e2\u0080\u009d Schmidt Cassegrain telescope is ideal for astroimagers and visual observers looking for a telescope that is much more portable than the reflector or refractor. The 6\u00e2\u0080\u009d Schmidt-Cassegrain optical tube offers 40% more light gathering ability than a 5\u00e2\u0080\u009d telescope. The Schmidt-Cassegrain design also eliminates chromatic aberration, making it a good choice for entry-level astroimaging. The Advanced VX mount is designed to provide superior performance while taking advantage of Celestron\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most advanced technologies: All-Star Polar Alignment, Celestron PWI telescope control software, SkyAlign, and permanently programmable periodic error correction (PPEC). If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re an experienced imager, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll love taking this portable mount to a dark sky site and enjoying all the conveniences of a larger observatory mount. Or, if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re new to imaging, \u00c2Advanced VX will help you get started with the hobby and keep up with your needs for years to come. Computerized German equatorial mount The Advanced VX is the smallest of Celestron\u00e2\u0080\u0099s German equatorial mounts. The computerized GoTo capability automatically tracks objects as they move across the night sky. The Advanced VX mount includes ports for a hand control, an autoguider, and 2 AUX ports for optional accessories.\u00c2 The NexStar+ hand control gives you instant access to all the functions your mount has to offer. With automatic slewing and menu descriptions, any level of astronomer can master this mount in just a few observing sessions. The Advanced VX also has an impressive tripod for its class with a 2\u00e2\u0080\u009d diameter steel tripod legs providing an extra-wide stance for improved stability. Payload capacity The payload capacity for the Advanced VX is 30 lb. It offers a sturdy platform for any of the Advanced VX optical tubes, even when paired with optional accessories like , StarSense AutoAlign , a Focus Motor , and a finderscope . Celestron's payload capacity does not include the weight of the counterweights.\u00c2 camera Dual saddle plateAs of early 2019, Advanced VX mounts include a dual saddle plate that accommodates both CG-5 and CGE-style dovetail. Switching between the two saddle plates is as simple as moving the hand knobs into a separate set of holes. You can use an Advanced VX mount with virtually any optical tube within its weight limit. Compatible with Vixen format dovetails 100mm or longer, not compatible with Losmandy D format plates (regardless of plate manufacturer). \u00c2 Software Celestron PWI Telescope Control Software Your Ultimate Astronomy Software Suite All current Celestron computerized telescopes include Celestron PWI (CPWI), the most advanced astronomy software suite provided with any consumer-grade telescope. Celestron\u00e2\u0080\u0099s experts co-developed CPWI with the engineers at PlaneWave Instruments. The result is an all-in-one solution offering you many of the same features used on PlaneWave\u00e2\u0080\u0099s observatory-class telescopes. Graphical planetarium interface with PointXP advanced mount modelling allows you to add 100+ points to your alignment model for the most accurate pointing and tracking possible Ideal for remote observatory setups: save and re-load your alignment and park your scope Provides a complete ASCOM telescope interface to allow control of the telescope from third party software applications For more information on CPWI and to see the user interface, click . here Starry Night SoftwareIncluded with your purchase is a free download of Celestron\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Starry Night Special Edition Software. This advanced software by Simulation Curriculum offers detailed information about celestial objects and helps you plan your next observing or imaging session.\u00c2The Special Edition software also allows you to control your telescope via computer."

Distinguished by its long, slender lens barrel, this macro lens provides a 2:1 maximum magnification with a 1.5' minimum focusing distance and a close 0.8' minimum working distance. Even with such a close working distance, the lens measures 1.3' long, placing you at a comfortable distance to photograph nearby subjects. Also, as a wide-angle lens, greater depth of field is afforded when compared to traditional telephoto macro lenses, which allows for greater detail in the background with less subject isolation.The optical design includes both extra-low dispersion and extra refractive index elements, which help to suppress chromatic and spherical aberrations for a high degree of clarity, color accuracy, and sharpness. Manual focus control permits focusing from 1.5' to infinity, and the front of the lens has a built-in LED ring light to aid in focusing at close distances. The slim 0.2' diameter of the front of the lens barrel also offers greater opportunities for lighting subjects from the front. Additionally, the front portion of the lens is waterproof, and permits working with subjects just beneath the surface of water or in other dusty or trying environments.Slim 0.8' front diameter allows performing unique 'slide-in' shots as well as affords a greater range of close-up, inconspicuous shooting opportunities. The smaller front diameter also makes it easier to illuminate close-up subjects from the front.The front of the lens is also waterproof, allowing you to comfortably work just under the surface of water or in dusty environments."
