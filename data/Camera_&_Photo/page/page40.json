The modest maximum aperture enables a relatively portable design that is well-suited to handheld, walkaround use and optical image stabilization also helps to steady photos and videos by up to five stops when working in difficult lighting conditions. This lens is also characterized by its advanced optical design, which includes a series of Super UD and UD elements to greatly reduce chromatic aberrations and color fringing throughout the zoom range for a degree of clarity and color accuracy.Manufacturer Included Items:Canon RF 100-500mm f/4.5-7.1L IS USM LensCanon E-77 II 77mm Lens CapCanon Lens Dust Cap RFCanon ET-83FW III Lens HoodCanon LZ1328 Lens CaseTripod CollarBundle Items Include:1 x Canon RF 100-500mm f/4.5-7.1L IS USM Lens1 x 77mm 3 Piece Filter Kit1 x Pro Sling Backpack1 x SanDisk 64GB Ultra SDXC Memory Card1 x Memory Card Reader1 x 12_inch Flexible Tripod1 x Memory Card Wallet1 x Lens Cap Keeper1 x Cleaning Kit1 x Hand Strap"

        "product_descriptions": " it also provides an astrograph-quality flat focal plane all the way to the edge of the field of view. True Astrograph Quality Many optical designs that advertise themselves as 'astrographs' actually only produce pinpoint stars across a curved focal plane. While this may be acceptable for some visual observing, stars will appear out of focus at the edge when used with the flat chip sensor of a digital camera. EdgeHD optics produce a focal plane more than three-times flatter than a standard Schmidt-Cassegrain telescope and dramatically flatter than competing coma-free designs. This guarantees you visibly sharp stars across some of the largest CCD chips available today.\u00c2 Improved Performance Superior edge performance not only creates rounder, more pleasing stars, but actually improves the resolution and limiting magnitude when compared to telescopes of equal aperture. With Celestron\u00e2\u0080\u0099s StarBright XLT optical coatings on every surface, EdgeHD optics gives you maximum light throughput across the widest visual and photographic spectrum. Mechanical Features In addition to EdgeHD\u00e2\u0080\u0099s optimized optical design, the telescope tube has been redesigned to make sure you get the most from your optics each and every night. Mirror clutches- Flexible tension clutches hold the mirror in place and reduce image shift when taking long exposure astro-images. Once focused, the flexible rods allow the mirror to be held in place without putting any force or pressure on the mirror assembly, keeping the image centered in the eyepiece (or on the sensor). Tube vents- Cooling vents located on the rear cell allow hot air to be released from behind the primary mirror. Each vent has an integrated 50-mesh filter guaranteed to let warm air out without letting dust in. Fastar versatility- EdgeHD is the most versatile imaging telescope available today. At its native f/10, you can achieve the image scale necessary to capture the smallest of deep sky objects. A Barlow gives you added power for high-resolution planetary, lunar and solar imaging. All EdgeHD optical tubes are Fastar-compatible, allowing the secondary mirror to be removed and replaced with a third party lens accessory for ultra-fast f/2 wide field imaging. Individually Tested Every EdgeHD that ships has been tested not only for the surface quality of each optical component, but also with a camera and artificial star to ensure the imaging system meets our rigid quality assurance. This \u00e2\u0080\u009cfinal acceptance test\u00e2\u0080\u009d confirms the EdgeHD will perform in the field and deliver high-quality astroimages."

        "product_descriptions": "MD) CL) U) LEICA MINILUX ZOOM The Leica Minilux Zoom offers the fastest zoom lens ever put on a compact Leica--the Vario-Elmar 35-70mm zoom lens. Housed in a body of high-grade titanium, this is one of the most versatile and deluxe compact 35mm cameras ever made. Another feature that makes the Minilux Zoom stand out is a hot shoe mount for the Leica CF flash unit (sold separately) in addition to the built-in flash. This allows you to reduce red-eye and light up objects from a greater distance. The Minilux Zoom also offers an active infrared autofocus or manual focusing from about 28 inches to infinity. The exposure metering system is center-weighted for extremely accurate exposures. Other outstanding features include a self-timer with 10-second countdown indicated by a flashing red light, tripod thread, data back for date imprinting, and an exposure value memory function which allows you to calculate your exposure from an object that is not in the center of your picture frame. The Minilux Zoom also has a number of exposure and focus settings that allow for a great deal of creative control. It can even be set to start out on your preferred mode every time you turn on the camera. About Leica Seventy-five years ago, the first Leica camera was introduced to the public at the 1925 Leipzig Spring Fair. At the time, it was by far the most innovative 35mm camera ever produced (as well as one of the very first). Since then, no camera in the world has been more widely acclaimed for continuously meeting the highest standards of excellence in both optical precision and design quality. Notably, many internationally acclaimed photographers such as Henri Cartier-Bresson and Sebasti\u00e3o Salgado have used Leica cameras throughout their careers. We think you'll find that Leica compact cameras maintain the same integrity as the M and R models used by the pros, but at more affordable prices. The lenses in all Leica 35mm cameras are still designed by the Leica optical department in Solms, Germany. Every compact camera is also tested for quality in Germany before being released. When you choose Leica, you are buying into one of the great traditions in the history of photography."
