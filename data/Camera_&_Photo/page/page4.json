At the heart of the camera, the LUMIX S5 contains a 24.2-megapixel 35mm full-frame CMOS sensor that boasts a wide dynamic range and high sensitivity performance made possible by sufficient light condensation. The LUMIX S5 further realizes recording maximum ISO51200 crystal-clear high sensitivity video with the adoption of the Dual Native ISO technology. The LUMIX S5 is capable of 4K 60p/50p 4:2:0 10-bit, and 4K 30p/25p 4:2:2 10-bit internal recording. It is also capable of 4K 60p/50p 4:2:2 10-bit HDMI output. For 4K 30p/25p 4:2:0 8-bit internal recording, there is no time limit. Panasonic's exceptional heat dispersion technology realizes stable, long time video recording. The LUMIX S5 provides 14+ stops of dynamic range, which is as wide as those of cinema cameras, and V-Log / V-Gamut compatibility with popular colorimetry called VariCam Look. A variety of recording formats and modes including 4:3 Anamorphic mode, Slow & Quick Motion, 4K/60p interval shooting and 4K HDR are also provided. The LUMIX S5 boasts high-speed, high-precision AF in both photo shooting and video recording that are made possible with advanced deep-learning technology featuring real-time detection of the subject's type and parts such as human eye, face, head and body. Combining the Body I.S. (5-axis) in the camera and the O.I.S. (Optical Image Stabilizer, 2-axis) in the LUMIX S Series lens, the 5-axis Dual I.S.2 compensates for blurring even powerfully, allowing the use of a 6.5-stop*3 slower shutter speed. The splash/dust-resistant rugged design provides professional photographers with high reliability. To enhance the photographic experience, the 96-megapixel High Resolution Mode (JPEG/RAW), Live View Composite function and HLG Photo mode are available. LUMIX S 20-60mm F3.5-5.6 Lens included."

Sony's vast expertise brings you the world's lightest1 full frame F4 wide-angle power-zoom lens, giving today's content creators refined imagery, expression and control. A new power zoom system in a compact lens is suitable for small crews or solo shooting. It is ideal for stills too, with beautiful G lens rendering and astonishing AF (autofocus) performance.",
          "Smooth power zoom with rapid response. A new power zoom system driven by four XD (Extreme Dynamic) Linear Motors for the first time in an Alpha lens provides smooth control with the immediacy of manual zoom. Even subtle zoom ring rotation is precisely detected and instantaneously converted to zoom operation. A continuously variable zoom lever makes it easy to execute super-slow constant-speed zooms, and zoom can be remotely controlled while the camera is mounted on a gimbal.",
          "Designed for refined movie imagery. In addition to smooth, versatile power zoom, this remarkably compact lens minimizes angle of view shifts that can occur when focusing or zooming so that stable, high quality movie footage can be easily captured. Focus, zoom and aperture operation are also extremely quiet, greatly reducing noise and vibration that can interfere with movie recording.",
          "Three-ring control: zoom, focus and aperture. Independent zoom, focus, and aperture rings on this compact lens offer flexible, intuitive creative control. Responsive zoom control is indispensable for movies, and Linear Response MF ensure that the focus ring responds directly and repeatably to subtle control when focusing manually. The aperture ring has an aperture click switch that allows the click stops to be turned off when smooth, seamless aperture adjustment is required as well as a lock switch to avoid inadvertently shifting from auto control.",
          "Constant or variable zoom speed controllable from lens or compatible cameras/remotes. Power zoom can be controlled with the response and immediacy of a manual zoom with the lens ring. Slow and fast zoom rate is accessible from the lens zoom lever. Up to 8 speeds can be set from the zoom lever or custom keys on compatible cameras. Zoom functions of compatible cameras can be operated without touching the camera by Bluetooth connection from compatible remote controls or Smart devices with Imaging Edge Mobile."

        "product_descriptions": "High-Power, Large Binoculars Perfect for Star Gazing or When You Cant Get Close Enough. (Featuring an Image Stabilizer and All-Weather design). With its wide 50mm objective lenses and high magnification, these rugged, all-weather Canon Image Stabilizer binoculars are destined to set a new and higher benchmark for image brightness, clarity and ergonomic design. Filter size: 58 mm, Closest Focusing Distance: 19.7 feet, Exit Pupil Diameter: 2.8mm, Eye Relief: 15mm. Canon's 18x50 IS binoculars incorporate an optical image stabilizer for shake-free viewing and minimal eye fatigue. This technology was first developed for Canon video camcorders and is now available in many of Canon's binoculars. The system employs a Vari-Angle Prism, dual transparent plates, independent vertical and horizontal sensors, and a dedicated microprocessor to continuously adjust the prism to maintain a steady image. The 18x50 IS binoculars feature a water-resistant, shock-resistant rubber coating for a nonslip grip and better durability. If you get caught in the rain and still want to view, you don't have to worry about the optics fogging up. These binoculars deliver high magnification and wide-field viewing. Controls for focusing and image stabilization are centrally located and accessible by both hands. These binoculars provide long eye relief for extra comfort. Image Stabilization and More With any high magnification binoculars, most users will experience frustrating image shake. Unless fixed to a tripod, image shake can render high magnification binoculars useless. Canon's IS technology is remarkably effective at eliminating this problem and is widely used by the television industry with Canon's professional broadcast quality video recording equipment. A special VAP (Vari-Angle Prism) corrective IS system sits between the objective lens group and the porro prism on each side of the binoculars. Within thousandths of a second of the binoculars being moved from their optical axis by vibrations, a detection system activates the IS mechanism. The VAP shape alters to refract or 'bend' the light path by precisely the right amount, thus fully compensating for the vibration. It is this essentially immediate response that effectively suppresses image shake. Super Spectra Coating A number of optical factors affect the brightness of an image, including the amount of incidental light that is reflected by the lens. An uncoated lens will refelect away as much as 8% of the incidentail light, significantly dimming the image. Canon's Super Spectra Coating prevents that reflection. What do the numbers mean? 15x50? 8x25? The two numbers used to describe any pair of binoculars are their magnification \u0097 8x, 12x, 15x and so on \u0097 and the diameter of their objective lenses \u0097 25mm, 36mm, 50mm, and so on. The larger the first number is, the larger the object will appear to be in the objective lens. For instance, if you use a 10x lens and look at an object that is 100 yards away, it appears to be the same size as an object located just 10 yards away. The second number, the size of the objective lens, is important because the larger the objective lens, the more light it can admit for brighter, more detailed images, and the better suited they will be for lowlight situations.
