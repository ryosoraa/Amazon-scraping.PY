This allows you to take shots that are as realistic as possible, and it makes color-correcting your images easier in post-production. In addition, Catta lenses promise to produce vivid and natural skin tones.Parfocal Design.With a parfocal optical design, the DZOFILM Catta Zoom lenses feature reduced focus breathing. As a result, unlike still photography lenses, the focus remains constant when the focal length changes, allowing for zoom racking without losing focus. To set up a shot, you can zoom in as far as you like and set a focus. The image will remain sharp as you zoom out to your desired framing.Geared Rings, T Stops.Each cinema lens has an aperture range of T2.9 to T22. DZOFILM uses a 16-blade aperture diaphragm for smooth and round bokeh. The minimum focus distance is around 2.5 feet, so you can get some great close-ups with an attractive blurred background. With 270 degrees of travel, the geared focus ring ensures smooth and precise focusing and zooming.Lightweight Build.DZOFILM Catta Zoom lenses measure around 7 inches long for the PL mount and around 7.4 inches long for the EF mount.

The smaller objectives reduce the overall size and weight for better portability and less muscle strain during long-duration viewing sessions, while still delivering competent low-light performance. Helping to compensate for the distracting hand shake common with using 10x and greater optics, is a wide 67? apparent viewing angle. This allows the use of high-magnification binoculars without the need for stabilization equipment such as harnesses.Manufacturer Included Items:Leica 10x32 Ultravid HD-Plus BinocularsCordura Nylon CaseContoured Neoprene Strap2 x Eyepiece Caps2 x Objective Lens CapsBundle Items Include:1 x Leica 10x32 Ultravid HD-Plus Binoculars1 x Pro Sling Backpack1 x 72-Inch Full Size Pro Monopod1 x Deluxe Cleaning Set2 x Lens Cap Keeper1 x Neck Strap"

This can largely be attributed to the new camera's high resolution 42.4 MP sensor paired with its large aperture, fixed focal length ZEISS Sonnar T* 35mm F2 lens, which have been fine-tuned to optimize performance together. Additionally, the RX1R II features a 30% improvement in AF response speed compared to the original award-winning RX1 models and is equipped with the world's first optical variable low pass filter that can be set to 'off', 'standard' or 'high' based on user preference, with low pass filter bracketing available. The camera also has a convenient retractable XGA OLED viewfinder for eye-level shooting, which has been implemented with minimal change in overall body size from its predecessors. Ultimate Image Quality in the Palm of Your Hand The RX1R II camera utilizes a back-illuminated 35mm full-frame Exmor R CMOS sensor with approx. 42.4 effective megapixels paired with a powerful BIONZ X processing engine to achieve superior levels of image resolution and sensitivity (ISO 100-25600, expandable to 50 - 1024002) with wide dynamic range. The sensor's back-illuminated structure, with an expanded circuit scale and copper wiring design, enables faster transmission speed and output"

        "product_descriptions": "The Nikon D610 DSLR Camera features a full-frame, FX-format 24.3 megapixel CMOS sensor and EXPEED 3 image processor to produce high-resolution still imagery and full HD 1080p video with notable image detail and low-light sensitivity to an expandable ISO 25600. The sensor and processor work together to enable high image quality with a wide dynamic range and high signal-to-noise ratio. These two technologies also combine to provide a wealth of speed throughout the D610, including a continuous shooting rate of 6 fps and a quiet shooting mode.A Multi-CAM 4800 AF sensor is integrated into the camera's design and produces fast autofocus speeds using a 39-point array to precisely acquire focus in a wide array of lighting conditions. When recording movies or working in live view, a contrast-detection focusing method works to continuously deliver accurate focus with subject-tracking and face-detection capabilities using the full-time servo mode. Full HD 1080p video is supported up to 30 fps in the MPEG-4 AVC/H.264 format and manual control over the ISO, shutter speed, and aperture is possible for optimized control over the look and feel of movies.Manufacturer Included Items:1 x Nikon EN-EL15 Lithium-Ion Battery Pack1 x Nikon MH-25 Quick Battery Charger1 x Nikon AN-DC10 Camera Strap1 x Nikon BF-1B Body Cap Cover1 x Nikon DK-21 Rubber EyecupTHIS NIKON INTERNATIONAL CAMERA BUNDLE CONTAINS:1 x Nikon D610 DSLR FX-Format Digital Camera (Body)1 x Nikon AF NIKKOR 50mm f/1.8D FX Lens (2137)1 x SanDisk 64GB Ultra SDHC SD Memory Card1 x EN-EL15 Compatible Lithium-Ion Battery1 x Large Digital SLR Camera Gadget Bag1 x 52mm Professional Telephoto Lens1 x 52mm 4-Piece Deluxe Filter Kit1 x 52mm-58mm Step-Up Ring1 x 52mm Tulip Lens Hood1 x Lens Cap Keeper Strap1 x USB SD Card Reader1 x Memory Card Wallet1 x Deluxe Cleaning Kit"
