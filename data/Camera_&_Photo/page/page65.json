Comprised of seven elements in five groups, and incorporating a single aspherical element, this lens eliminates nearly all distortions and spherical aberrations throughout the focusing range. This design also contributes to a high degree of sharpness, contrast, and clarity, and the f/2 maximum aperture enables working in difficult lighting conditions with ease. Additionally, an 11-blade aperture contributes to smooth out-of-focus rendering when working with selective focus and shallow depth of field techniques. Despite its wide-angle focal length and fast maximum aperture, this manual focus lens still remains relatively compact to benefit its use as an everyday, go-to lens for M shooters.Inside The Box:Leica Summicron-M 35mm f/2 ASPH Lens (Silver)Lens HoodMetal Lens CapThreaded Protection RingLeica Rear Lens Cap for M-Mount LensesExtra Items From 6Ave:Padded Lens CaseNeck StrapLens Cap KeeperCleaning Kit"

        "product_descriptions": "The AmScope ME400TA metallurgical trinocular microscope has interchangeable pairs of 10x and 16x widefield eyepieces, a forward-facing nosepiece with four DIN infinity plan achromatic objectives, Brightfield episcopic halogen illumination, a Kohler condenser, and a double-layer mechanical stage with a stage stop to protect slides and objectives from damage. The trinocular viewing head has a 23mm vertical camera mount, a Siedentopf binocular head to adjust interpupillary distance, a fixed 30-degree vertical inclination to reduce eye and neck strain, and a 360-degree rotation capability to enable sharing. The Siedentopf head has a range of 55 to 75mm to accommodate individual eye differences, and bilateral dioptric adjustment to accommodate individual eye-strength differences. A Siedentopf binocular head enables the viewer to change the interpupillary distance without changing the tube length, eliminating the need to re-focus the image. The forward-facing quadruple nosepiece has 4x, 10x, 20x, and 40xS (spring) DIN infinity plan achromatic objectives that combine with the eyepieces to provide color correction of magnified images. Infinity plan objectives provide focus over the entire range of the viewing field, and a longer working distance for improved focus when auxiliary components are utilized. The 40xS objective is spring loaded to prevent slide damage when focusing. A metallurgical microscope uses transmitted and reflected light to view opaque or metallic specimens, or larger specimens that cannot be viewed on a standard microscope stage. The microscope has reflected episcopic (upper) illumination that reflects light off the specimen for enhanced visibility of opaque specimens. The episcopic illumination system has independent filter holders for yellow, blue, green, and frosted filters (included). Kohler illumination focuses and centers the light path using two iris diaphragms, providing optimum contrast and resolution. The 20W halogen light source provides bright light in a concentrated path and has a rheostat to control light intensity. The double-layer mechanical stage, with 1mm stage divisions and 0.1mm vernier graduations, locks the slide into place and provides precise slide manipulation along the X- and Y-axis to allow coordinates to be recorded, enabling the viewer to return to a specific location on the slide. A stage stop prevents the stage from coming into contact with the slide and objectives. The stage is 5.9 x 5.5 inches (150 x 140mm) and has a traveling range of 3.0 x 2.0 inches (75 x 50mm). Graduated coaxial coarse and fine focus has a focusing range of 1-9/16' (40mm). Focus knob tension control prevents the stage from drifting out of focus. The microscope has a mechanical tube length of 6-5/16' (160mm). The enamel-coated cast-steel body is durable and resistant to stains and corrosion. Microscopes are instruments used to enhance the resolution of an object or image. Types include compound, stereo, or digital. Compound microscopes use a compound optical system with an objective lens and an eyepiece. Stereo microscopes show object depth in a three-dimensional image. Digital microscopes are used to display an image on a monitor, rather than looking through a lens. Microscopes can have monocular (one), binocular (two), or trinocular (three) eyepieces, with varying magnification abilities. Magnification ability refers to the size of an image. Resolution, also known as resolvant power, refers to the clarity of the image. The interaction between field of view (FOV), numerical aperture (NA), and working distance (WD) determines resolution. Microscopes can control magnification through a fixed focus, or through a range of adjustments. They can also utilize LED, fluorescent, and mirror light sources to help control viewing capabilities. Microscopes are widely used in education, lab research, biology, metallurgy, engineering, chemistry, manufacturing, and in the medical, forensic science, and veterinary industries. United Scope manufactures microscopy equipment and accessories under the brand name AmScope. The company, founded in 1996, is headquartered in Irvine, CA."

The camera has a USB 2.0 data port (cable included). The microscope has Brightfield (BF) illumination which allows the specimen to absorb light, resulting in a dark image on a light background. Halogen light source provides bright light in a concentrated path, and a Kohler condenser focuses and centers the light path using two iris diaphragms, providing optimum contrast and resolution. The graduated double-layer mechanical stage, with 1mm stage divisions, locks the slide into place and provides precise slide manipulation along the X- and Y-axis to allow coordinates to be recorded, enabling the viewer to return to a specific location on the slide. A stage stop prevents the stage or specimen from coming into contact with the objectives. The stage is 7.1 x 5.9 inches (180 x 150mm) and a traveling range of 3 x 2 inches (75 x 50mm). Graduated coaxial coarse and fine focus has a focusing range of 1-3/16' (30mm) and fine-focus divisions of 0.002mm (0.0000787') that enable measurements to be taken. Focus knob tension control prevents the stage from drifting out of focus. The cast-alloy enamel-coated body is durable and resistant to stains and corrosion. Microscopes are instruments used to enhance the resolution of an object or image. Types include compound, stereo, or digital. Compound microscopes use a compound optical system with an objective lens and an eyepiece. Stereo microscopes show object depth in a three-dimensional image. Digital microscopes are used to display an image on a monitor, rather than looking through a lens. Microscopes can have monocular (one), binocular (two), or trinocular (three) eyepieces, with varying magnification abilities. Magnification ability refers to the size of an image. Resolution, also known as resolvant power, refers to the clarity of the image. The interaction between field of view (FOV), numerical aperture (NA), and working distance (WD) determines resolution. Microscopes can control magnification through a fixed focus, or through a range of adjustments. They can also utilize LED, fluorescent, and mirror light sources to help control viewing capabilities. Microscopes are widely used in education, lab research, biology, metallurgy, engineering, chemistry, manufacturing, and in the medical, forensic science, and veterinary industries. United Scope manufactures microscopy equipment and accessories under the brand name AmScope. The company, founded in 1996, is headquartered in Irvine, CA."
