Thanks to the generous use of special lens elements, the 70-180mm F/2.8 achieves excellent optical performance from center to edge. With the short MOD (Minimum Object Distance) of 33.5', the 70-180mm F/2.8 expands the possibilities for photographic expression.

          "Live in detail with the world's first 40-megapixel APS-C sensor X-H2 blends the compact and lightweight versatility of APS-C mirrorless cameras with an unmatched back-side illuminated X-Trans CMOS 5 HR imaging sensor. Add in an optimized pixel layout that promises exceptional detail, unrivaled color accuracy, and impressive video flexibility, these game-changing features are made possible only with X-Processor 5, which delivers lightning-fast performance to help X-H2 deliver 8K/30p video, enhanced autofocus capabilities, and black-out free image bursts at 15fps. Not to mention, it's also more efficient than its predecessor, boosting battery performance by 10%.",
          "X-H2 uses its native 8K video resolution to give filmmakers several ways of unlocking the camera's true potential. X-H2 offers a suite of video functions that make it perfect for every moviemaking occasion. Apple ProRes 10-bit 4:2:2 footage can be recorded internally at up to 8K/30p using a CFexpress Type B card, while 12-bit Apple ProRes RAW*1 or Blackmagic RAW*2 footage can be recorded to compatible external devices* via the full-size HDMI Type A port. Additionally, when recording video using the F-Log2 color profile, X-H2's dynamic range extends to 13+ stops  a one-stop improvement over the previous sensor, enhancing post-production flexibility.",
          "Pixel Shift Multi-Shot X-H2 is the first X Series to feature Pixel Shift Multi-Shot, which delivers 160-megapixel images for the ultimate quality when detail really matters. A staple of GFX System cameras, Pixel Shift Multi-Shot records 20 frames, shifting the sensor by 0.5 pixels between each frame. Resulting images are automatically combined into one DNG RAW file, which can be output to a desired file format using suitable RAW processing software. This groundbreaking feature is invaluable for archival recording and other commercial applications where color fidelity and fine detail are paramount. Using Pixel Shift Multi-Shot ensures false colors and moir\u00e9 effects are suppressed.",
          "Improved in-body image stabilization (IBIS) offers seven stops of compensation and features an enhanced algorithm that improves motion detection. This produces shake-free results in more scenarios than ever before, most notably when panning or following subjects on foot for video. For stills photographers, full-resolution images can be recorded at an incredible 15 frames-per-second when using the mechanical shutter, while those switching to the electronic shutter can work at 20fps in the 1.29x crop factor option. Further high-speed options are provided by the electronic shutter's 1/180,000 sec top speed, while photographers seeking optimum quality will welcome the lower minimum ISO 125.",
          "With its broad range of wired and wireless options for transferring image and video data, the X-H2 camera body supports wireless image transfer through the Fujifilm Remote Camera App and natively delivers webcam resolutions of up to 4K/60p for a high-quality live streaming experience. With the optional VFT-XH Wireless File Transmitter Battery Grip functionality is expanded even further. The grip adds tethering connections and FTP file transfer through Wi-Fi, Ethernet and smartphone connections, plus the Remote Rec function. This enables up to four camera bodies, with VFT-XH battery grips attached, to be connected and controlled via a web browser on a computer, tablet or smartphone."

Even when extended to the 500mm telephoto end, the lens is still compact enough for comfortable handheld shooting. This zoom lets users enjoy casual shooting with steady performance and high image quality in the ultra-telephoto realm where conventional wisdom once dictated a tripod. To support handheld shooting in the ultra-telephoto range, the 150-500mm is equipped with VXD (Voice-coil eXtreme-torque Drive), a linear motor focus mechanism that delivers excellent quietness and agile performance, and TAMRON's proprietary VC (Vibration Compensation) mechanism for high-level image stabilization. At the 150mm end, the lens offers an MOD of 23.6 for powerful and dramatic close-ups."
