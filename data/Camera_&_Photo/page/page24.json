Thus, the LPTTM (Leica ProTrack) tracking assistant can display any previously-measured point on a connected cellphone. This facilitates target checks when shooting at long range or in the mountains.The proven rubber-armored magnesium housing is rugged and protects its high-end interior from the elements, making Leica Geovid Pro models utterly reliable companions."

The chromatic aberration is minimized with the two extra-low dispersion (ED) glass elements, two Super ED glass elements, and one ED aspherical element. The G Master lens achieves lovely bokeh with its advanced optical design combined with the F2.8 aperture and the new 11-blade circular aperture unit. A XA element has 0.01-micron surface precision which suppresses onion bokeh. Precise AutoFocus and Movie Capabilities Four of the extreme dynamic (XD) linear motors deliver high-thrust efficiency and boost the autofocus speed. This way you will get fast and continuous autofocus and tracking for stills and movies. The FE 70-200mm F2.8 GM OSS II lens, is designed with movie capabilities in mind. The latest lens reduces focus breathing, focus shift, and axis shift when zooming. The lens operates quietly and you have independent control rings (for focus, zoom, and iris) with a click on/off switch at your disposal. A Lightweight Lens with Professional Control With just an overall weight of 2.3 lbs, it is 23 percent lighter than the previous model. The new design improves its balance while the constant barrel length gives you easy handling. This lens has flexible focus control provided by features such as full-time direct manual focus, linear response, and a focus range limiter. The aperture ring with switchable click and an iris lock gives you extra exposure controls. Bundle Includes:"

This updated sensor design achieves enhanced image clarity, resolution, and dynamic range, along with adept sensitivity to ISO 25600 and low noise to suit working in a variety of situations. Combined with advanced image processing, this sensor is also capable of outputting UHD 4K30p and Full HD 120p video, as well as supporting continuous stills shooting rates up to 10 fps.
