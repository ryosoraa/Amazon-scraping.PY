Further 6.6 update features include support for additional languages, USB PTP control, customizable frame guides, an up to 8x pinch-to-zoom function, and the ability to embed custom LUTs as metadata in Blackmagic Raw, and more. The Micro Four Thirds lens mount accommodates the original, lightweight Pocket Cinema Camera lenses, and can be used with PL, C, EF, and other lenses with the use of separately available adapters. A dual-native ISO of up to 25,600 is featured for low-light capture, and 13 stops of dynamic range provide rich HDR images. Record using the internal CFast 2.0 and SD/UHS-II card slots or employ the USB Type-C output for capturing longer clips to an external drive. The Pocket Cinema Camera 4K's 5' touchscreen LCD reduces the need for an external, onboard monitor, while a full-sized HDMI port enables you to output a signal to a larger display. The menu and interface are the same as the ones found on the URSA Mini camera, and 3D LUTs can be applied for monitoring or baking in your look when you're ready to commit."
