X-T5's improved image processing algorithm delivers outstanding results, packed with detail right across the native ISO range, which now extends to ISO 125. The classic X Series design has been retained. Dials predominate, making key functions - including ISO, shutter speed and exposure compensation - quick an",
          "X-T5 provides powerful image making performance to ensure it's ready for action, no matter how fast your subject is moving. A top electronic shutter speed of 1/180,000 sec and maximum mechanical shutter speed of 1/8000 sec will stop any subject in its tracks, while a lag time of just 35 ms gives almost instantaneous response when the shutter release is pressed. Keep a finger down, and X-T5 will record images at up to 15fps with the mechanical shutter, or 20fps with the electronic shutter. With",
          "Thanks to X-T5's in-body image stabilization (IBIS) system, camera shake will be a thing of the past - even in low-light conditions. It works in five axes, combatting all types of camera movement, and provides up to seven stops of compensation. IBIS works with the camera's subject detection autofocus, which uses deep-learning AI to expertly track animals, birds, cars, motorcycles, planes and trains. Tracking moving subjects is made easier by the detailed electronic viewfinder (EVF), which uses",

The feature utilizes the camera's IBIS system to precisely shift the sensor, automatically recording 20 separate frames with one press of the shutter release. Resulting files are combined using Pixel Shift Combiner software to quadruple the camera's resolution and produce a detail-rich, 160-megapixel file.

Just like the classic Leica Summilux-M 35 f/1.4. The true king of bokeh As the world's fastest wide-angle lens, the Leica Summilux-M 35 f/1.4 set the photographic benchmark in 1961. Today it continues to inspire with its exceptional images. Especially shots at open aperture fascinate with their individual, almost fairy-tale look, which is really difficult to achieve through digital editing. A distinctive bokeh and vignetting at maximum aperture, got the Summilux-M 35 f/1.4 its title as the 'true king of bokeh'. Photographing at open aperture in backlit conditions creates intended lens flares that can be used for specific creative effects. At smaller apertures it delivers very sharp and almost distortion-free pictures that easily meet all modern requirements on image quality. Elegance in a compact form Anyone picking up the Summilux-M 35 f/1.4 for the first time immediately gets why countless renowned photographers refused to take it off their camera. And why Leica is reviving it with a virtually unaltered 1961 vintage look and identical optical design. Its stainless-steel front ring. Lockable focus ring. And the black clip-on lens hood. They're all modelled on the original. New, on the other hand, is the second lens hood this classic comes with. This alternative, round version has an E46 thread for filters. Which - in addition to its compactness, extremely low 200g weight and its precise controls - make the Summilux-M f/1.4/35 a versatile prime lens for every M camera"

Track fast moving subjectseven those moving erratically, at random speeds or approaching the camera quicklywith tack-sharp AF precision. During high-speed continuous shooting, the electromagnetic diaphragm mechanism operates in sync with the camera shutter for fast automatic exposure control and consistency between shots, even when using a compatible teleconverter. This is a lens built for tough assignments. A new magnesium alloy barrel and fluorite elements reduce the overall weight by nearly 3 pounds versus its predecessor**. The protective front meniscus is coated with Nikon's nonstick Fluorine coat, which makes it easier to wipe off water, dirt and smudges.

The amount of shift is +/-11mm for full frame camera and +/-8mm for medium format cameras. The lens is perfect for architectural and interior photography. The sky-high buildings can be captured in a corrected perspective easily. Image quality is guaranteed with high image sharpness and nearly no distortion (Zero-D). 15mm f/4.5 Zero-D Shift enriches the diversity of Laowa's extensive wide-angle lens collection by giving photographers more control on the perspective in their images. World's Widest Shift Lens 15mm f/4.5 Shift is the widest shift lens for full-frame cameras. The angle of view is 110 Degree , and it covers a huge 65mm image circle. The wider perspective offers a great deal of flexibility for photographers to capture architecture and interior shots when space is limited. +/-11mm Shift Amount The maximum possible shift amount of the lens is +/-11mm for full frame camera and +/-8mm for medium format camera (e.g. Fujifilm GFX / Hasselblad X1D). The shift capability allows photographers to capture straight architecture with ease. 15mm f/4.5 Zero-D Shift straightens the lines that appear to converge in the distance. Crooked images can be corrected by changing the perspective of the lens. Perspective distortion is being eliminated to create the reality-like image. The +/-11mm shift amount also allows photographers to expand the angle of view by stitching multiple images. It gives an extraordinary image perspective and rooms for special compositions. Large Image Circle With a huge 65mm image circle, the lens not only works with the full-frame format but also covers the medium format sensors. This makes it currently the World's Widest lens covering Fujifilm GFX sensor with no vignetting."

To attainthe highest pinnacle of binocular performance, a total of 4 XD lenses(2 sets of 2 lenses) are utilized in the objective end of the binoculars. This significantly reduces chromatic aberr The Kowa Genesis 44-10x High Performance 10x44 millimeter Binoculars (Green) are sporting optics of the highest quality. These high-performance binoculars are built with a rugged construction, and a full set of features, making them perfect for anybody looking for portable magnification, be it for purely recreational uses, or more serious outdoor exploration. All the lenses and prisms in the BD42-10GR binoculars are manufactured with multi-layered coating, ensuring a bright and clear visual range, while the roof prism has phase correction coating and a highly reflective aluminum coating to ensure sharp images and accurate color reproduction. Through the use of a Bak4 prism these Kowa binoculars are able to give you bright, clear images all the way to the edge of the objective lens. Kowa's BD42-10GR roof prism uses the schmidt-Pechan prism, where one surface of the Pechan prism does not provide total reflection, so they have applied a highly reflective multi-coating of dielectrics, called a C3 coating. This allows for a much higher reflectivity than with coatings of silver or optically-enhanced aluminum, offering a reflectance of 99-percent or higher across the entire visible spectrum of 400 to 700 millimeters. Not only does this increase the brightness and sharpness of the images, but ensures an accurate color reproduction is also achieved. Furthermore, the roof surface of the Schmidt prism is phase coated (phase correction coated) to prevent the loss of contrast and image resolution. The stylish green housing of the Kowa BD42-10GR is waterproof and filled with dry nitrogen gas to prevent the lens from fogging, which allows these binoculars to be used in the rain and other harsh weather conditions. At the same time, these binoculars feature easy-to-use, twist-up eyecups with a large, 16-millimeter eye-relief suitable for both eyeglass wearers and non-eyeglass wearers. With easy focusing and a smooth turning focus wheel, and a minimum focusing distance of only 5.5 feet, these binoculars can be used for many purposes. The use of an inner focusing mechanism has made it possible for the BD42-10GR binoculars to retain a light, compact design, weighing only 34 ounces and measuring only 5.4 x 2.5 x 6.5 inches (W x H x D). These binoculars sport an 10x magnification, provide an apparent field of view of 65 degrees and 354 feet at 1,000 yards, and are backed by an astounding manufacturer's lifetime of the product warranty."
