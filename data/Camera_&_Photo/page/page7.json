          "With an unprecedented ultra-wide 20 mm to short-telephoto 70 mm zoom range, this versatile lens is an excellent choice for a wide range of movie and still subjects. The ultra-wide 20 mm end of the zoom range maintains a wide angle of view when shooting movies with a 16:9 or 2.35:1 aspect ratio that reduces field of view.",
          "Two XD (extreme dynamic) Linear Motors achieve fast, quiet, smooth focus drive with up to 60% higher AF speed and up to two times better performance while tracking for reliable, precise tracking. Moving subjects are reliably tracked when shooting continuous stills at up to 30 fps, or up to 4K 120p with alpha compatible cameras.",
          "Advanced technology reduces focus breathing as well as focus and axial shift when zooming so that distracting image shifts are minimized. XD Linear Motors and a newly developed aperture unit dramatically reduce noise and vibration when shooting movies. The breathing compensation function provided in compatible  series cameras is also supported.",
          "This compact, lightweight lens combines state-of-the-art optical design with Sony's high-thrust XD (extreme dynamic) Linear Motor technology. The deep, soft bokeh available with full-frame image sensors is further enhanced by a 9-blade circular aperture and optimally tuned spherical aberration. All of this supports the creation of impressive, memorable imagery.",
          "AA (advanced aspherical) elements help to achieve a minimum focus distance of 11.8 (30 cm - wide) to 9.8 (25 cm - telephoto) when using AF, and 9.8 (25 cm) throughout the zoom range when focusing manually. Maximum magnification is 0.39x for detailed close-ups. Close focus makes it easy to maneuver around small subjects to find the ideal angle."

          "X-H2S is the first X Series camera to feature the 26.1-megapixel, X-Trans 5 stacked back-illuminated sensor. The unique X-Trans color filter array that minimizes moir\u00e9 and false colors, placing the sensor's circuitry on a separate layer from the pixels delivers outstanding image quality thanks to expanded low light capabilities and up to 14-stops of dynamic range. The new X-Processor 5, offers lightning-fast performance for the most demanding situations. Capable of handling vast amounts of data, X-Processor 5 delivers next-level performance enhancements in video and stills processing capabilities and intelligent autofocus functionality that's 3x faster than Fujifilm's preceding X-T4 model.",
          "Powerful video features make X-H2S a go-to device  both for hybrid image makers and dedicated motion professionals. Up to 90 minutes of footage can be internally recorded with a single battery, at a wide range of resolutions and frame rates up to 6.2K/30P in Open Gate 3:2, 4K/120P, and Full HD/240P. This delivers unparalleled flexibility within the X Series lineup. Additionally, the ability to record 10-bit 4:2:2 Apple ProRes footage internally to CFexpress Type B memory cards offers incredible post-production flexibility, while the X-Trans 5 sensor's 14-stop dynamic range optimizes the level of image detail across a uniquely wide exposure range.",
          "The autofocusing system in X-H2S is not only quick, but also highly advanced. Capable of working in light levels down to -7EV and keeping up with both fast and erratically moving subjects, it now features Subject Detection autofocus, utilizing AI to deliver an unmatched autofocus performance. Previous X Series models offer Face and Eye Detection AF, X-H2S's Subject Detection AF broadens the range of identifiable subjects to further enhance focusing accuracy. The new system can identify and track cars, planes, trains, motorcyclists, birds, horses, dogs, cats and more. Furthermore, face and eye detection capabilities have been expanded to pick up hairlines, glasses, and face coverings.",
          "X-H2S delivers powerful performance, suitable for any professional photographer or filmmaker. Continuous shooting is possible at 15 frames-per-second with the mechanical shutter, and up to 40 frames-per-second when the electronic shutter is deployed. These impressive speeds are backed up by the camera's high-capacity buffer, which allows unlimited continuous recording and writing of JPEG and RAW files to a high-speed memory card when using the mechanical shutter. Creative possibilities abound with by the camera's in-body image stabilization system, offering up to seven stops of shake reduction to give the handheld user true versatility.",
          "In addition to a wide range of internal video recording features, X-H2S provides significant flexibility for external recording. F-Log or F-Log2, Apple ProRes RAW and Blackmagic RAW footage can all be recorded to an external device through the camera's standard, Type A HDMI port. Unlock the full capability of X-H2S's unmatched image quality by recording F-Log or F-Log2 in resolutions of up to 6.2K in Apple ProRes RAW*1 and Blackmagic RAW*2 . *1 Atomos Ninja V+ HDR Monitor Recorder Required *2 Blackmagic Design Video Assist Monitor Required"
