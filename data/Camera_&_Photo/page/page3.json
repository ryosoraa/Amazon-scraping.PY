One of its best features is the Back-Side Illuminated (BSI) Full-Frame Image Sensor. Why is that so important? Well the technology of this sensor means that the light-collecting parts of the sensor are much closer to the surface of the chip that most other sensors. This equates to dramatically improved low-light performance and improved quality on the edges of your photos. BSI Full-Frame Image Sensor At the heart of the D850 is a back-side illuminated (BSI) FX-format full-frame CMOS image sensor with 45.7 megapixels and no optical low-pass filter. It achieves extraordinary image quality, enhanced light gathering efficiency, faster data readout and truer color. And with such a dense array of pixels, there's virtually no risk of moire. Detail and Sharpness Faster than EXPEED 4, EXPEED 5 quickly processes all 45.7 megapixels of data for lower noise, wider dynamic range, subtle tonal and textural details, high-speed continuous shooting at approx. 9 fps and full-frame 4K UHD movie recording. Autofocus That Keeps Up The D850 uses the same field-proven ultra-accurate AF system as the flagship D5. With 153 focus points, 99 cross-type sensors and a dedicated AF processor, the D850 delivers all of its 45.7 MP performance with NIKKOR lenses. Autofocus down to -4 EV lets you capture in low-light situations. Bundle Includes:"

Combined with the new Dual Pixel CMOS AF II system with approx. 100% coverage of the frame, and 1,053 Automatic AF Zones, the EOS R6 will confidently follow elusive subjects at 20fps for sharp images. Tracking subjects is easy and intuitive with the ability to track people using Eye, Face and Head Detection AF, or when tracking the whole body, face or eye of cats, dogs, or birds with Animal Detection AF. With the new 5-axis In-Body Image Stabilizer, up to 8-stops of shake correction is possible with both non-stabilized and optically image-stabilized lenses, opening up many more creative opportunities for incredibly stable lower light photo or video content creation. Those looking for creative cinematic video options will appreciate frame rates including 4K 60P and Full HD 120P with the option of internally recorded 4:2:2 10-bit Canon Log or HDR-PQ recording. And the inclusion of Dual SDXC UHS-II card slots combined with Wi-Fi and Bluetooth allows for multiple transfer and automatic backup options, making the EOS R6 ready when you are."
