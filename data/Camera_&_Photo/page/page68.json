The stand can be secured with the clamp to the edge of a desk or table. Microscopes are instruments used to enhance the resolution of an object or image. Types include compound, stereo, or digital. Compound microscopes use a compound optical system with an objective lens and an eyepiece. Stereo microscopes show object depth in a three-dimensional image. Digital microscopes are used to display an image on a monitor, rather than looking through a lens. Microscopes can have monocular (one), binocular (two), or trinocular (three) eyepieces, with varying magnification abilities. Magnification ability refers to the size of an image. Resolution, also known as resolvant power, refers to the clarity of the image. The interaction between field of view (FOV), numerical aperture (NA), and working distance (WD) determines resolution. Microscopes can control magnification through a fixed focus, or through a range of adjustments. They can also utilize LED, fluorescent, and mirror light sources to help control viewing capabilities. Microscopes are widely used in education, lab research, biology, metallurgy, engineering, chemistry, manufacturing, and in the medical, forensic science, and veterinary industries. United Scope manufactures microscopy equipment and accessories under the brand name AmScope. The company, founded in 1996, is headquartered in Irvine, CA."

UHD 4K 60p video is supported, too, with the option to record externally in 10-bit using N-Log or HLG (HDR) modes). The sensor also incorporates a 493-point phase-detection AF system, which now supports Eye-Detect AF in Wide-Area AF modes and during movie recording, and permits focusing in low-light down to -4.5 EV.",

        "product_descriptions": " perfect for imagers and visual observers alike.\u00c2 The 11\u00e2\u0080\u009d optical tube offers 41% more light gathering than a 9.25\u00e2\u0080\u009d telescope. The Schmidt-Cassegrain design also eliminates chromatic aberration, making it a good choice for entry-level astroimaging. The Advanced VX mount is designed to provide superior performance while taking advantage of Celestron\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most advanced technologies: All-Star Polar Alignment, Celestron PWI telescope control software, SkyAlign, and permanently programmable periodic error correction (PPEC). If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re an experienced imager, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll love taking this portable mount to a dark sky site and enjoying all the conveniences of a larger observatory mount. Or, if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re new to imaging,\u00c2 Advanced VX will help you get started with the hobby and keep up with your needs for years to come. Computerized German equatorial mount The Advanced VX is the smallest of Celestron\u00e2\u0080\u0099s German equatorial mounts. The computerized GoTo capability automatically tracks objects as they move across the night sky. The Advanced VX mount includes ports for a hand control, an autoguider, and 2 AUX ports for optional accessories.\u00c2 The NexStar+ hand control gives you instant access to all the functions your mount has to offer. With automatic slewing and menu descriptions, any level of astronomer can master this mount in just a few observing sessions. The Advanced VX also has an impressive tripod for its class with a 2\u00e2\u0080\u009d diameter steel tripod legs providing an extra-wide stance for improved stability. Payload capacity The payload capacity for the Advanced VX is 30 lb. It offers a sturdy platform for any of the Advanced VX optical tubes, even when paired with optional accessories like , StarSense AutoAlign , a Focus Motor , and a finderscope . Celestron's payload capacity does not include the weight of the counterweights.\u00c2 camera Dual saddle plateAs of early 2019, Advanced VX mounts include a dual saddle plate that accommodates both CG-5 and CGE-style dovetail. Switching between the two saddle plates is as simple as moving the hand knobs into a separate set of holes. You can use an Advanced VX mount with virtually any optical tube within its weight limit.\u00c2 Compatible with Vixen format dovetails 100mm or longer, not compatible with Losmandy D format plates (regardless of plate manufacturer). \u00c2 Software Celestron PWI Telescope Control Software Your Ultimate Astronomy Software Suite All current Celestron computerized telescopes include Celestron PWI (CPWI), the most advanced astronomy software suite provided with any consumer-grade telescope.

        "product_descriptions": "Sony Camera Lenses SAL70200G2 Zoom from 70mm medium telephoto to 200mm telephoto with a constant F2.8 maximum aperture. Original Sony Nano AR Coating technology suppresses internal reflections, minimizing flare and ghosting for outstanding clarity from highlights to well-defined blacks. Four ED glass elements contribute to prime-lens class sharpness throughout the zoom range, but this lens can also produce gorgeous background bokeh when needed. When changing your aperture to defocus the background, the light sources appear blurred. This \u2018bokeh' effect of the blurred background can be enhanced with circular aperture blades used in this lens. Conventional aperture blades have flat sides creating unappealing polygonal shaped defocussed points of light.  lenses overcome this problem through a unique design that keeps the aperture almost perfectly circular from its wide-open setting to when it is closed by 2 stops. Smoother, more natural defocusing can be obtained as a result. Effectively suppress reflections that can cause flare and ghosting with Sony's original Nano AR Coating technology. This precisely defined regular nano-structure allows accurate light transmission, contributing to high-quality images, even more so than lenses with coatings that use an irregular nano-structure. The reflection suppression characteristic of the Nano AR Coating is superior to conventional anti-reflective coatings, providing a notable improvement in clarity, contrast, and overall image quality. As focal lengths get longer, lenses built with conventional optical glass have difficulties with chromatic aberration, and as a result images suffer from lower contrast, lower color quality, and lower resolution. ED glass dramatically reduces chromatic aberration at telephoto ranges, and provides superior contrast across the entire image, even at large aperture settings. Super ED glass provides enhanced compensation for chromatic aberration. Once you've adjusted focus to where you want it, pressing this button on the lens barrel will keep the lens locked to that focusing distance. The preview function can also be assigned to this button through the camera's custom settings. This function allows you to set a limit on the focusing range which can save you time during AF operation as the lens will not \u2018hunt' through the entire focusing range. In macro lenses, this limit can be on either the near or far range (as pictured). In the SAL70200G, the limit is set on far ranges only. In the SAL300F28G, focusing can be limited either to a far range or to a range that you specify yourself. The distance encoder plays an integral part in ADI flash metering, which delivers high precision flash metering that is unaffected by the reflectance of subjects or backgrounds. The distance encoder is a lens component that directly detects the position of the focusing mechanism, and sends a signal to the CPU in order to measure distance to the subject. During flash photography, this data is very useful in calculating how much flash output is appropriate to the scene. Only the middle groups of the optical system move to achieve focus, so the overall length of the lens does not change. Other important benefits include fast autofocusing and a short minimum focusing distance. Also, the filter thread at the front of the lens does not rotate, which is convenient if you're using a polarizing filter. SSM is a piezoelectric motor that contributes to smooth and silent AF operation. The motor produces high torque at slow rotation, and provides immediate start and stop responses. It is also extremely quiet, which helps keep autofocusing silent. Lenses that feature SSM also include a position-sensitive detector to directly detect the amount of lens rotation, a factor that improves AF precision overall. 2013 Sony Electronics, Inc.
