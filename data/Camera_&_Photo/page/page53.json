The advanced optical design controls various forms of aberration to achieve edge-to-edge sharpness across the entire zoom range. The use of a newly-developed Nano-GI (Gradient Index) coating technology effectively inhibits ghosting and flare, producing clear images. This is a convenient standard zoom lens that covers a wide range of shooting scenes from the wide-angle 24mm equivalent suitable for landscape photography, to the medium-telephoto 84mm equivalent, ideal for portraiture. The XF16-55mm lens is driven with a linear motor, allowing comfortable shooting with fast, quiet autofocusing. Featuring a weather resistant and dust-resistant finish that can work in temperatures as low as -10 Degree C and can be paired with the 'FUJIFILM X-T1' premium mirrorless camera to take advantage of the fully weather-resistant system . Optically designed to draw out the maximum image quality as a flagship standard zoom lens In order to achieve the best-in-class image quality, the fast standard zoom lens with a constant aperture of F2.8 consists of 17 elements in 12 groups. This includes three aspherical lens elements to control spherical aberration"

Sporting a high-resolution 45.7MP FX-format BSI CMOS sensor and dual EXPEED 6 image processors, the Z7 II is clearly aimed at the detail-obsessed image-maker. The sensor's design omits the optical low-pass filter for greater detail recording capability and the sensor supports a native sensitivity range down to ISO 64 for lush.",

UHD 4K 60p video is supported, too, with the option to record externally in 10-bit using N-Log or HLG (HDR) modes). The sensor also incorporates a 493-point phase-detection AF system, which now supports Eye-Detect AF in Wide-Area AF modes and during movie recording, and permits focusing in low-light down to -4.5 EV.",
          "Additionally, 5-axis in-body Vibration Reduction helps to reduce the appearance of camera shake with any mounted lens. Balancing the imaging, the Z7 II retains its overall physical design, however it has been updated with a new dual memory card slot interface to hold one CFexpress Type B card and one SD UHS-II card for more flexible storage.Both a high-res 3.6m-dot OLED EVF and rear 3.2' 2.1m-dot tilting touchscreen LCD lend versatility to image composition and playback, and SnapBridge.",

With a new rugged design, durable construction, and streamlined power efficiency, the Taiko is the perfect addition to any field or studio lighting setup. The Taiko's advanced connectivity features allow you to add it into any studio setup or lighting grid. Whether you're working in the studio with AC power, or on location with battery power, you'll benefit from the same power output and performance to illuminate your creative vision. The Taiko is precisely manufactured in Norway to Luxli's specifications. Its 2 x 1-foot LED configuration boasts a powerful output capacity along with a compact enclosure. This multicolor LED light features a highly accurate and versatile RGBAW LED that provides amazing accuracy across the white color spectrum. The unit's color adjustment modes will illuminate your subject with any hue of light you can imagine using RGB mode or the 150 built-in digital filters. Special effects are preprogrammed yet editable to give your video lifelike drama and immediacy. The light is equipped with Bluetooth 4.2 LE that pairs with your tablet or smartphone when you open Luxli's Composer mobile app. The Taiko supports DMX 512 so it will seamlessly fit into any lighting grid. Master and apprentice mode allow you to attach multiple Taikos and other Orchestra-series studio lights and control them from a single unit. Whether controlled via the app, the interface on the unit itself, or DMX, the Taiko will illuminate your creative vision with endless possibilities. Powerful Output The Taiko is Luxli's most powerful light to date, with an output of 15,500 lux, which is more than 3.5 times more powerful than Luxli's Timpani 1x1 LED. This means the lights can be moved further back and still cast brilliant light. With the diffuser installed, the Taiko's output is 9800 lux, still more than twice the output of the Timpani, while reducing the harshness of the direct raw light output. Accurate and Versatile RGBAW LED The accurate and versatile RGBAW LEDs open a whole new range of creative possibilities. Color mixing on each LED means higher accuracy and full panel output, regardless of settings. The 'A' and 'W' in RGBAW stand for amber and white, 3000 and 5600 K color temperature LEDs, respectively. And thanks to the amber and white LEDs, brightness and accuracy apply to any color temperature. Precise Color Rendering at All Color Temperatures You won't need to spend your time at the computer, color correcting your shots. With an average TLCI/CRI rating of 98/95 across the entire color temperature range, the Taiko's color output is extremely accurate. Detailed Photometric Data Every Taiko is individually calibrated and tested before it leaves the factory. A serialized photometric calibration result sheet is included with every light that lists the lux output, CRI, TLCI, and color gamut of your light. Color Adjustment and Effects Modes Building on the innovative features introduced with Luxli's Timpani 1X1, the Taiko offers adjustment modes that will take your lighting to the next level. The Taiko's color adjustment modes are accessible from the onboard control panel or via the Composer App and will illuminate your subject with any hue of light you can imagine."

        "product_descriptions": "The PC-E Micro NIKKOR 85mm f/2.8D Perspective Control (PC) lens corrects linear distortion in order to better replicate images assen by the human eye, including straightening the converging lines of rectilinear objects such as buildings, while also introducing welcome command over depth-of-field. Their versatility makes these the perfect lens complement for a myriad of applications, including photographing architecture, nature, interiors and still-life especially product photography. When shooting subjects, such as tall buildings with a conventional lens, composition often calls for tilting the axis of a camera. This typically results in a significant distortion of converging lines, impacting the desired visual accuracy of the image. A PC-E NIKKOR lens' 'shift' control provides correction for this type of distortion. 'Shift' control can also give a photographer the ability to 'effectively' move the apparent position of the camera providing further perspective versatility, allowing, for example, the ability to avoid unwanted reflections in an image. A PC-E lens' 'tilt' control gives photographers additional creative control over depth-of-field. Known as the Scheimpflug principal,tilt-shift lenses are capable of modifying the focal plane of the lens, allowing the extension or limitation of the point of critical sharpness in the image. The combination of 'tilt' and 'shift' controls featured in all PC-E NIKKOR lenses gives photographers extraordinary control over perspective control which simply is not possible with conventional lenses. A special tilt/shift mechanism gives users up to +/- 11.5mm shift for perspective control and +/- 8.5-degree tilt control for creative focus. The Perspective Control lenses correct distortion and vanishing point issues with convenient side-mounted controls at 1mm / 1-degree intervals that will adjust the fo Perfect for portrait, nature, and commercial photography, the Nikon medium-telephoto 85mm, f/2.8D lens lets you control the perspective more than with other lenses, with the ability to tilt, shift, and rotate while you shoot. The lens offers a wide shifting range--plus or minus 11.5mm--with a tilting range of plus or minus 8.5 degrees to provide exceptional perspective control. In addition, the lens revolves plus or minus 90 degrees in 30-degree increments, providing versatile tilt/shift shooting effects. As a result, you can enjoy all kinds of distorted perspectives and unique angles, giving your shots extra life. The lens is coated with Nikon's Nano Crystal Coat, which virtually eliminates internal reflections across a wide range of wavelengths to produce even greater image clarity. The high-performance Nikon Super Integrated Coating (SIC), meanwhile, offers superior color performance and substantially reduced ghosting and flare. Other details include an auto-aperture control with an electromagnetic diaphragm (requires Nikon D3, D700, or D300 D-SLR camera), and a rounded nine-blade diaphragm that produces a more natural appearance for out-of-focus image elements.
