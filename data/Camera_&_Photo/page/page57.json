The wide-area AF (L) AF-area mode is supported, ensuring the capture of eyes and faces by limiting the focusing area.",

The dials control shutter speed, exposure compensation and ISO sensitivity, allowing quick, efficient setting changes. Using the aperture display window, users are able to easily confirm and adjust the four basic settings for image-making at a glance. The i button and i menu support efficient shooting, by allowing quick adjustment of a variety of settings with the press of a button.",

Additionally, shooting from high angles, as well as vertical shooting from low angles, is enabled with the adoption of the first vari-angle monitor among Z series cameras. When the monitor is rotated to the front, the camera automatically switches to self-portrait mode, providing smooth selfie shooting through touch operation."

VC (Vibration Compensation) and USD (Ultrasonic Silent Drive) enable you to shoot crisp images of fast-moving, distant subjects handheld, while proprietary Tamron optical technology, including eBAND Coating, works to suppress flare and ghosting for impressively clear, vibrant images. Three LD (Low Dispersion) elements are effectively deployed to correct chromatic aberrations, a challenging problem when shooting at long distances and at long focal-length settings. Tamron's eBAND Coating and BBAR (Broad-Band Anti-Reflection) Coating help suppress flare and ghosting for class-leading image quality.VC (Vibration Compensation) is Tamron's proprietary image stabilization system. Tamron's VC is a three-coil system, whereby three driving coils activate the shake-compensating VC lens group electromagnetically via three ceramic ball bearings. The quiet high-torque USD motor ensures a speedy and accurate autofocus response. This new coating technique developed by Tamron deploys a Nano-structured layer (1 nm = 1/1,000,000mm) of ultra-low refractive index, with dimensions smaller than the wavelengths of visible rays of light. This Nano-structured layer coupled with the sophisticated multiple layer coatings underneath, yields significant anti-reflection properties, efficiently reducing undesired flare and ghosting to an absolute minimum to deliver sharp, crisp images. While covering a very wide range of focal lengths, this lens is remarkably compact and accepts 95mm filters. Its stylish design with signature Tamron tungsten silver finish and elegant brand ring incorporates a sturdy tripod mount to enhance both stability and ease of use. Moisture-resistant construction helps prevent moisture from penetrating the lens. Products not sold by Tamron Authorized USA Dealers in the USA are considered gray market and as such do no"

It combines the best of almost every model listed here and crams them all into one single titanium body. Contax spared no expense in making this an extremely durable and reliable camera, attached with a Carl Zeiss Sonnar 35mm f/2.8 gem of a lens that can focus closer (up to .4m) and more quickly than the Contax T2. This one comes with the super duper Zeiss six element Sonnar 35mm f/2.8, which is scary in its sharpness and balance. The latter term model is called 'double teeth' and has 2 film winding teeth."
