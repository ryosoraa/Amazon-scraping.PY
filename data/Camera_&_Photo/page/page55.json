Larger deep sky objects and rich star fields are its natural playground. Looking on-axis your field-of-vision is filled with 100 of stars, however wherever you chose to concentrate your attention you'll see sharpness and richer contrast. The optical performance of the 21mm is the work of Ethos lead designer Paul Dellechiaie, who achieved a level of optical aberration correction right in line with his other Ethos designs. Contrast and transmission have been maximized using the same advanced coating techniques and further aided by the internal mechanical design techniques used in all Tele Vue eyepieces. Extending the Ethos focal length range to 21mm while maintaining the original performance goals of the rest of the series brings the eyepiece up against the mechanical limits of the 2' barrel and focus constraints. The 21mm provides the maximum true field of view, has no significant vignetting at the edge of the field, and is parfocal with the 31mm Nagler Type 5. The 21mm focal length completes the logical set of 21mm/13mm/8mm and nicely juxtaposes the 17mm/10mm/6mm combination. Each step within these two sets approaches a 3x field area gain. The 21mm's effective field stop diameter is 36.2mm, bringing its true field close to the 35mm Panoptic (38.7mm Field Stop diameter). Its true field is also lar"
