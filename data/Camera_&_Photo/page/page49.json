        "product_descriptions": "The optical structure of the Leica Normal 50mm f1.4 Summilux M Aspherical Manual Focus Lens, Black consists of eight lens in 5 groups. Glass with anomalous partial dispersion (elements 2/3) was used to ensure correct color rendition. Lens element 2 is made of a fluorite-type glass while lens element 3 is made from glass originating from the former Leitz glass laboratory. Lens element 4 has an aspherical surface. Lens elements 1, 6 and 7 are made of glass with a very high refractive index to minimize monochromatic aberrations. In all every innovation currently available in lens technology - aspherical lenses, glass with anomalous partial dispersion (APO), glass with a high refraction index and a floating element - has been combined to create a lens that will set new imaging standards. This is the first Leica M lens with a specifically patented 'floating element' used to maintain imaging performance at a very high level even in close-focus ranges down to 0.7m. During focusing, the rearmost optical component (elements 7/8) moves relative to the rest of the optical system and produces brilliant image quality in near focus ranges. To maximize the benefits of the 'floating element' an extremely precise adjusting mechanism has also been utilized that had to fit into the restricted space inside this compact M-lens At full aperture, the LEICA SUMMILUX-M 50mm f/1.4 ASPH. offers high contrast rendering even for the finest structures. This performance can only be raised slightly by stopping down. Another notable feature of this lens is that it is virtually distortion-free. The normal vignetting for such high-speed lenses at full aperture is strongly reduced by stopping down slightly. Furthermore, the use of the most advanced coating technology ensures a high degree of anti-glare. The LEICA SUMMILUX-M 50mm f/1.4 ASPH. also offers special features in terms of its handling: The built-in lens hood not only provides protection against stray light and dust, it can also be"

For the first time with a NIKKOR PC lens, the direction of tilt operation can be made parallel or perpendicular to shift, allowing you to control perspective, focus and depth of field like never before. Tilt to create scenes with selective defocus (miniature effect) or sharp focus throughout the scene. Shift to control the effects of keystoning and fix issues of perspective in-camera. In photography or filmmaking, the Nikon PC-E NIKKOR 19mm f/4E ED Tilt-Shift Lens can help you create images as unique as your creative vision.FEATURES:Optimized for high-resolution cameras - As an ultra-wide-angle lens and a perspective control lens, the PC NIKKOR 19mm f/4E ED has to work double duty combating distortion and glare. And does it ever. Three Extra Low Dispersion (ED) glass elements and two Aspheric glass (AS) elements virtually eliminate chromatic aberration and coma, even at the widest aperture setting. Nano Crystal Coat (N) increases backlight tolerance for clear images with minimal ghosting and flare. Like all NIKKOR lenses, image quality comes first with the PC NIKKOR 19mm f/4E ED.Ideal for architecture, interiors, landscapes and panoramas - A 19mm angle of view on FX cameras is very similar to the angle of view prized by many large- and medium-format photographers. This sweeping, ultra-wide perspective is ideal for landscapes, cityscapes, interiors, architecture, horizontal or vertical panoramas and filmmaking, and it gives you a broad, versatile brush with which to paint your images.New PC rotation capability - For the first time, a NIKKOR lens can be tilted and shifted independently and then rotated up to 90?. Tilt to control the plane of focus-creatively or precisely, the choice is yours. Shift to control perspective or create panoramas. Shift operation no longer requires locking and unlocking-smoothly and"

        "product_descriptions": "For years, Dobsonian telescopes have provided astronomers with the most bang for their buck using a large aperture and simple design. Viewing with a large aperture can provide a stellar experience, however the size of large reflector telescopes can pose problems for users looking to either store or transport their telescope from one location to another. The Sky-Watcher Collapsible Dobsonian solves this problem with a unique collapsible design using three retractable steel struts, allowing for easy storage and transit. Dobsonians are known for giving users a large aperture reflecting telescope at a low price, however they often lack portability. Sky-Watcher has innovated this classic telescope design by integrating a collapsible tube system, addressing users' portability concerns. Sky-Watcher Collapsible Dobsonians feature a strut system carefully designed to ease setup time in the field while delivering consistent optical performance. Each strut has preset indentations which place the optics in the same position time after time, maintaining collimation. Unlike Dobsonians using a truss-tube system, Sky-Watcher's Collapsible Dobsonian does not need to be disassembled. The strut system is comprised of three 1 steel poles, joining the bottom and top portion of the optical tube. When extended, three chrome locking screws hold the instrument in place. Unlike truss tube Dobsonians, Sky-Watcher's Collapsible Dobsonian holds collimation extremely well, forgoing the need to collimate each time it's used. The retracting design can shorten the optical tube up to 36%, making storage and transit much easier. At the heart of any Sky-Watcher telescope are observatory-grade optical components. The Collapsible Dobsonian is no exception, using components that yield exceptional contrast, 94% reflectivity and minimal vignetting. Mirrors are constructed with borosilicate glass, then coated with quartz, titanium and silicon dioxide to ensure an unparalleled viewing experience. Combining these superb optics with a large Dobsonian aperture helps ensure you'll have bright, bold views of faint deep sky objects. To ensure Sky-Watcher Dobsonians remain easy to use, all Collapsible Dobsonians include a mount base that is so smooth, it can be rotated with the push of a finger. 8 and 10 models come complete with Teflon bearings, while the larger 12 models use steel needle bearings to ensure smooth and easy movement. At Sky-Watcher, we want you to feel confident in your purchase, knowing that your telescope will come with all required accessories to start using your telescope. All Sky-Watcher Dobsonian telescopes include a 2 Crayford focuser and a 1.25 adapter, allowing you to utilize both 2 and 1.25 eyepieces. Also included, are two 1.25 eyepieces (25mm and 10mm), a 8x50 finderscope and eyepiece tray."

        "product_descriptions": " it also provides an astrograph-quality flat focal plane all the way to the edge of the field of view. True Astrograph Quality Many optical designs that advertise themselves as 'astrographs' actually only produce pinpoint stars across a curved focal plane. While this may be acceptable for some visual observing, stars will appear out of focus at the edge when used with the flat chip sensor of a digital camera. EdgeHD optics produce a focal plane more than three-times flatter than a standard Schmidt-Cassegrain telescope and dramatically flatter than competing coma-free designs. This guarantees you visibly sharp stars across some of the largest CCD chips available today. Learn more about EdgeHD technology. Improved Performance Superior edge performance not only creates rounder, more pleasing stars, but actually improves the resolution and limiting magnitude when compared to telescopes of equal aperture. With Celestron\u00e2\u0080\u0099s StarBright XLT optical coatings on every surface, EdgeHD optics gives you maximum light throughput across the widest visual and photographic spectrum. Mechanical FeaturesIn addition to EdgeHD\u00e2\u0080\u0099s optimized optical design, the telescope tube has been redesigned to make sure you get the most from your optics each and every night. Mirror clutches- Flexible tension clutches hold the mirror in place and reduce image shift when taking long exposure astro-images. Once focused, the flexible rods allow the mirror to be held in place without putting any force or pressure on the mirror assembly, keeping the image centered in the eyepiece (or on the sensor). Tube vents- Cooling vents located on the rear cell allow hot air to be released from behind the primary mirror. Each vent has an integrated 50-mesh filter guaranteed to let warm air out without letting dust in. Fastar versatility- EdgeHD is the most versatile imaging telescope available today. At its native f/10, you can achieve the image scale necessary to capture the smallest of deep sky objects. Add the optional reducer lens\u00e2\u0080\u0094custom-designed for your size EdgeHD tube\u00e2\u0080\u0094and you can increase your field of view without sacrificing optical performance. A Barlow lens gives you added power for high-resolution planetary, lunar and solar imaging. All EdgeHD optical tubes are Fastar-compatible, allowing the secondary mirror to be removed and replaced with a third party lens accessory for ultra-fast f/2 wide field imaging. Individually Tested Every EdgeHD that ships has been tested not only for the surface quality of each optical component, but also with a camera and artificial star to ensure the imaging system meets our rigid quality assurance. This \u00e2\u0080\u009cfinal acceptance test\u00e2\u0080\u009d confirms the EdgeHD will perform in the field and deliver high-quality astroimages. MOUNT INFO: A fresh update to the venerable CGEM mount, the CGEM II has a fresh, attractive, bold appearance and is capable of carrying Celestron\u00e2\u0080\u0099s higher-end SCT optical tubes (up to 11') securely and vibration free, which is ideal for both imaging and visual observing. Capable of holding 40 lbs. of payload and slewing at 5\u00c2 per second, you will be able to instantly point to any of the celestial objects in the database. ERGONOMIC DESIGN CGEM II was designed to be ergonomically friendly with large Altitude and Azimuth adjustment knobs for quick and easy polar alignment adjustment. The internal RA and DEC motor wiring provides a clean look and an easy and trouble free set up. INNOVATION The CGEM II series features Celestron\u00e2\u0080\u0099s innovative Polar alignment procedure called All-Star\u00e2\u0084\u00a2. All-Star allows users to choose any bright star, while the software calculates and assists with polar alignment. Another great feature of the CGEM II sure to please astroimagers, is the Permanent Periodic Error Correction (PEC) which will allow users to train out the worm gears periodic errors, while the mount retains the PEC recordings. PERFORMANCE For objects near the Meridian (imaginary line passing from North to South), the CGEM II will track well past the Meridian for uninterrupted imaging through the most ideal part of the sky. The CGEM II mount has a robust database with over 40,000 objects, 100 user defined programmable objects and enhanced information on over 200 objects. Celestron's CGEM II mount is the perfect fit between the Advanced Series and CGE Series. Offering the portability of the Advanced Series and the precision of the CGE."

The advanced G lens design includes an aspherical element and three ED (Extra-low Dispersion) glass elements in a precision optical design suppress aberration throughout the zoom range, including chromatic aberration that can be a problem at super-telephoto focal lengths. Sharp, clear image quality is easy to achieve at all focal lengths, right out to the image edges. Three ED (Extra-low dispersion) glass elements Three ED (Extra-low Dispersion) glass elements take axial chromatic aberration and chromatic aberration due to differences in magnification out of the picture, maximizing resolution and bokeh while leaving precisely rendered edges with no fringing or unnatural coloration, while significantly reducing flare and ghosting. XD Linear Motor for fast, precise, quiet AF Sony's advanced XD (extreme Dynamic) linear motor technology - the same type used in G Master series lenses - focuses on and tracks even fast-moving subjects with outstanding speed and precision. Coupled with the advanced real-time AF capability of the latest compact APS-C bodies, you have a high-performance, easy-handling system for landscapes, wildlife, and more. 7-blade circular aperture contributes to gorgeous bokeh The 7-blade circular aperture maximizes the beauty of this large-aperture prime-lens, contributing to impressive"
