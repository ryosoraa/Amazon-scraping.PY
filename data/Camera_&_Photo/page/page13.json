        "product_descriptions": "Sky-Watcher's premiere line of Maksutov-Cassegrain telescopes create a perfect blend of aperture and lightweight portability. This telescope design has a reputation for sharp, high-contrast views, ideal for planetary observation.Maksutov-Cassegrain telescopes serve as an alternative to Schmidt-Cassegrains and Newtonians, and offer astronomers a large visual aperture, high contrast, and long focal length in a compact package. Maksutov's deliver better planetary detail than other telescopes due to a focal length that's 5-7 times longer, increasing overall magnification. Maksutov-Cassegrains also uses a meniscus-shaped corrector plate, eliminating any spherical aberration caused by the primary mirror.Our Maksutov series telescopes deliver refractor-like views and superior contrast while allowing for larger apertures at a fraction of the cost. Our Maksutov series features a borosilicate primary mirror with an aluminum coating and a quartz overcoat, producing 94% reflectivity. The corrector plate utilizes our proprietary Metallic High -Transmission Coatings (MHTC), giving visual astronomers professional-grade optics, creating a unique viewing experience.In addition to the visual benefits of Sky-Watcher Maksutovs, these serve as excellent optical tubes for imaging planetary, lunar, or solar (with use of a solar filter). For astronomers looking to start in astrophotography, the Sky-Watcher Maksutovs deliver exceptionally long focal lengths, necessary for imaging planetary detail. This provides an increased image scale, forgoing the need of a barlow lens or other accessories that may increase exposure times.As customary with all Sky-Watcher products, the Maksutov series includes a bundle of accessories, including: a 28mm 2-inch eyepiece, 2-inch 90 degree star diagonal, and a 9x50 straight-through finderscope."
