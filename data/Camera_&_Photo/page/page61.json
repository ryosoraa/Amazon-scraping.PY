As you would expect from a cinema-style zoom, the lens is parfocal, meaning it holds focus throughout the zoom range. The internal focus design with floating elements virtually eliminates focus breathing. It covers a Super35 image circle, comes standard with an interchangeable PL mount, and includes an EF mount. The 16-blade iris creates round out-of-focus highlights, which have a more natural appearance and contribute to the lens's natural-looking bokeh. The lens features cine-style gear rings on the focus, iris, and zoom lens rings, making it compatible with cine-style lens accessories such as follow focus units, lens motors, and lens control systems. The 95mm outer front diameter allows you to use a variety of compatible third-party matte boxes, and the lens has an 86mm filter thread. A lens support foot allows you to support the lens on rods to help reduce strain on your camera's lens port. Please Note: According to the manufacturer, when converted to EF mount this lens is not compatible with DSLR cameras that have an EF mount. However, it is compatible with mirrorless cameras that have an EF mount, including Blackmagic Design cameras."

Imaging performance is in no way compromised by the camera's diminutive proportions. Instead, X-T5's improved image processing algorithm delivers outstanding results, packed with detail right across the native ISO range, which now extends to ISO 125.The classic X Series design has been retained. Dials predominate, making key functions - including ISO, shutter speed and exposure compensation - quick and easy to set, even with the camera switched off. X-T5 is also comparable in size"

Complementing the optics is intuitive handling, in which a stepping motor delivers fast, near-silent autofocus performance along with fine-tuned manual focus control. Additionally, four stop-effective optical image stabilization helps to reduce the appearance of camera shake for sharper handheld shooting and this 100-400mm is also compatible with the optional TS-111 Tripod Socket for steady shooting atop a tripod or monopod.Manufacturer Included Items:Sigma 100-400mm f/5-6.3 DG DN OS Contemporary Lens for Sony ESigma LCF-67 III 67mm Lens CapSigma Rear Cap LCR II for Sony E Mount LensesSigma LH770-05 Lens HoodSigma PT-31 Protective CoverBundle Items Include:1 x Sigma 100-400mm f/5-6.3 DG DN OS Contemporary Lens for Sony E1 x Pro Sling Backpack1 x SanDisk 64GB Ultra SDXC Memory Card1 x Premium Lens Case1 x Memory Card Reader1 x 3 Piece Pro Filter Kit UV, CPL, and FLD1 x Deluxe Cleaning Set1 x 12 Inch Flexible Tripod1 x Memory Card Wallet1 x Wireless Remote Shutter Release1 x Lens Cap Keeper"

Now, eleven instead of nine aperture blades are used for a visibly improved bokeh. In addition, the closest focusing distance was reduced from 70 to 40 centimeters. When shooting up to 70 centimeters, this works as usual via the rangefinder on all Leica M cameras. After a slight perceptible resistance, the extended close-focus range between 70 and 40 centimeters can be controlled via Live View on the screen, the Visoflex viewfinder or the Leica FOTOS app. Lastly, the lens hood is now round, directly integrated in the lens and can be easily available at any time. These new lenses will replace the current Leica Summilux-M 35 f/1.4 ASPH lenses while supplies last (11663). The optical formula and filter size (E46) remains unchanged with this new version. Close focus distance up to 0.4m Made possible by a patent-pending double cam unit newly developed by Leica engineers. As a result, the rotation angle of the focus ring has almost doubled to 176 degrees in comparison to the previous model -with the same compact size of the lens."

It works beautifully with both 1.4x II and 2x II extenders, and now focuses as close as 17.5 feet/5.4 m. It has the same weather-resistant gaskets and sealed focusing and focus pre-set rings as Canon\u00eds other Image Stabilized super-telephoto lenses. See a Different Dimension A super telephoto lens can make an ordinary scene into an extraordinary one. Its ability to see surpasses that of the human eye. It can compress images and make them look as if they come from another dimension. It opens up new realms of photographic expression. All EF super telephoto lenses are L-series lenses to provide the highest quality. The USM provides quiet and high-speed autofocusing. These lenses promise outstanding delineation and put your imagination to the test."
