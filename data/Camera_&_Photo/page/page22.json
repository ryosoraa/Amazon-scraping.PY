Quick and easy to use thanks to its classic, dial-based layout, the camera features cutting-edge technology. This includes a seven-stop in-body image stabilization system, Pixel Shift Multi-Shot mode for 160-megapixel files, three-way tilting LCD with 1.84 million pixels and action-freezing shutter speeds up to 1/180,000 sec from the electronic shutter.In addition to its versatile suite of stills capabilities, X-T5 is also a highly capable moviemaking machine, recording up to 6.2K in 4:2:2 10-bit color internally - or 12-bit Apple ProRes RAW and Blackmagic RAW via HDMI.Big Resolution, Compact DimensionsOffering the ultimate image quality, X-T5 features the class-leading, 40.2-megapixel X-Trans 5 HR CMOS sensor in a compact, lightweight body that maximizes functionality and portability. Imaging performance is in no way compromised by the camera's diminutive proportions. Instead, X-T5's improved image processing algorithm delivers outstanding results, packed with detail right across the native ISO range, which now extends to ISO 125.The classic X Series design has been retained. Dials predominate, making key functions - including ISO, shutter speed and exposure compensation - quick and easy to set, even with the came"
