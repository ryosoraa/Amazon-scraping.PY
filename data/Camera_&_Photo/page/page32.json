          "Offering the ultimate image quality, X-T5 features the class-leading, 40.2-megapixel X-Trans 5 HR CMOS sensor in a compact, lightweight body that maximizes functionality and portability. X-T5's improved image processing algorithm delivers outstanding results, packed with detail right across the native ISO range, which now extends to ISO 125. The classic X Series design has been retained. Dials predominate, making key functions - including ISO, shutter speed and exposure compensation - quick an",
          "X-T5 provides powerful image making performance to ensure it's ready for action, no matter how fast your subject is moving. A top electronic shutter speed of 1/180,000 sec and maximum mechanical shutter speed of 1/8000 sec will stop any subject in its tracks, while a lag time of just 35 ms gives almost instantaneous response when the shutter release is pressed. Keep a finger down, and X-T5 will record images at up to 15fps with the mechanical shutter, or 20fps with the electronic shutter. With",
          "Thanks to X-T5's in-body image stabilization (IBIS) system, camera shake will be a thing of the past - even in low-light conditions. It works in five axes, combatting all types of camera movement, and provides up to seven stops of compensation. IBIS works with the camera's subject detection autofocus, which uses deep-learning AI to expertly track animals, birds, cars, motorcycles, planes and trains. Tracking moving subjects is made easier by the detailed electronic viewfinder (EVF), which uses",
          "Following in the footsteps of X-H2, find the stunning Pixel Shift Multi-Shot mode in X-T5, delivering detailed files like never before. The feature utilizes the camera's IBIS system to precisely shift the sensor, automatically recording 20 separate frames with one press of the shutter release. Resulting files are combined using Pixel Shift Combiner software to quadruple the camera's resolution and produce a detail-rich, 160-megapixel file.

The bright f/1.0 maximum aperture suits working in low-light conditions and enables greater control over depth of field for isolating subjects using selective focus. Fabricating the aspherical front element is a more challenging process than producing a general mold aspherical lens, due to the high melting point of the high-refraction glass, which cannot be used in the mold manufacturing method. By grinding and polishing the aspherical front element it is possible to simplify the lens configuration, while ensuring high performance even when shooting with a wide-open aperture. The wide f/1.0 aperture lends a dreamlike quality to images. Its 12 blades provide a smooth, circular look, and sharpness is maintained throughout its focus and aperture range. With a robust, all-metal construction and classic black finish, this lens still maintains a compact form factor that does not obscure most view viewfinders."

The camera has a USB 2.0 data port (cable included). The fiber-optic ring light has a 150W/21V cool-light halogen light source for observing temperature-sensitive specimens. The ring light provides shadow-free illumination, and a rheostat controls the amount of light emanating from the lamp. The ring light has a 2-1/8' (56mm) inner diameter, a 3-1/8' (80mm) outer diameter, and a 35' (890mm) metal-sheathed light cable. Power and adjustment controls are located on a control box to speed adjustments. The light source has a forced-air cooling system to prevent overheating, and a built-in filter slot can be used to change the light color (filters sold separately). The top-mounted door eases access to the bulb, and automatically turns off the power supply when opened. The light uses a 110V power supply. The pillar-type articulating-arm base has a 40' reach for covering a large work space. The pillar is 24' and the holder ring has a 3' diameter. The stand can be secured with the clamp to the edge of a desk or table. Microscopes are instruments used to enhance the resolution of an object or image. Types include compound, stereo, or digital. Compound microscopes use a compound optical system with an objective lens and an eyepiece. Stereo microscopes show object depth in a three-dimensional image. Digital microscopes are used to display an image on a monitor, rather than looking through a lens. Microscopes can have monocular (one), binocular (two), or trinocular (three) eyepieces, with varying magnification abilities. Magnification ability refers to the size of an image. Resolution, also known as resolvant power, refers to the clarity of the image. The interaction between field of view (FOV), numerical aperture (NA), and working distance (WD) determines resolution. Microscopes can control magnification through a fixed focus, or through a range of adjustments. They can also utilize LED, fluorescent, and mirror light sources to help control viewing capabilities. Microscopes are widely used in education, lab research, biology, metallurgy, engineering, chemistry, manufacturing, and in the medical, forensic science, and veterinary industries. United Scope manufactures microscopy equipment and accessories under the brand name AmScope. The company, founded in 1996, is headquartered in Irvine, CA."
