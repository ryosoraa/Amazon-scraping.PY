The sensor's design omits the optical low-pass filter for greater detail recording capability and the sensor supports a native sensitivity range down to ISO 64 for lush.",

UHD 4K 60p video is supported, too, with the option to record externally in 10-bit using N-Log or HLG (HDR) modes). The sensor also incorporates a 493-point phase-detection AF system, which now supports Eye-Detect AF in Wide-Area AF modes and during movie recording, and permits focusing in low-light down to -4.5 EV.",

Balancing the imaging, the Z7 II retains its overall physical design, however it has been updated with a new dual memory card slot interface to hold one CFexpress Type B card and one SD UHS-II card for more flexible storage.Both a high-res 3.6m-dot OLED EVF and rear 3.2' 2.1m-dot tilting touchscreen LCD lend versatility to image composition and playback, and SnapBridge.",

The optical tubes are nitrogen filled to prevent internal fogging and O-ring sealed to be waterproof and submersible for short periods of time.
