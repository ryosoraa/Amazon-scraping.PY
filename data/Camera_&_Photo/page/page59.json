With the lens construction of 25 elements in 19 groups, consistent image quality can be created throughout the entire zoom range. This lens also incorporates Intelligent OS adopting the latest algorithm to deliver an image stabilization effect of 4 stops. The high-speed AF, thanks to the HSM (Hyper Sonic Motor) with an updated algorithm, captures instantaneous photography movement. High ratio, high image quality, and high mobility - The SIGMA 60.600mm F4.5-6.3 DG OS HSM - Sports marks the birth of a lens that is on another level from existing high ratio zoom lenses. High optical quality meeting the most stringent needs of professional photographers This lens incorporates three FLD ('F' Low Dispersion) glass elements and one SLD (Special Low Dispersion) glass element to provide excellent correction of magnification chromatic aberration encountered in hyper-telephoto shooting. This offers both high resolution and consistent edge to edge performance through the entire zoom range. In addition, when shooting at the focal length of 200mm, the SIGMA 60 600mm F4.5-6.3 DG OS HSM - Sports can also be used for telephoto macro photography, with a maximum magnification ratio of 1:3.3, thanks to its high rendering performance.

          "VIRTUALLY DISTORTION-FREE OPTICS: Dramatic perspectives and a view from extraordinary image angles - ZEISS lenses open up new composition possibilities. Distortion would disrupt the composition because straight lines, whose image does not go through the image center, would be reproduced with a curved shape. This annoying effect is accordingly and largely compensated through elaborate optical designs at all focal lengths.",
          "EXCELLENT IMAGE QUALITY: ZEISS lenses offer the highest possible standards in terms of performance, reliability and, of course, image quality. Quite simply, they are superior in every way. You can count on highly advanced flare control for crisp and brilliant images, and virtually zero geometric distortion, ensuring precise accuracy when reproducing shapes  especially useful when photographing products and architecture.",
          "EXCELLENT RESOLUTION AND HIGH CONTRAST: Richly saturated and vivid colours are a must in the creation of lasting impressions. However, stray light within an optical system leads to a lightening of the image that is particularly noticeable in the shadows. This reduces image contrast, with the result that exposures lack contrast and appear faded. To avoid this, ZEISS combines various specially developed technologies to reduce the undesirable effects of stray light.",
          "MINIMIZED FOCUS SHIFT: ZEISS T ZM-mount lenses are specifically designed to minimize focus shift with aperture changes  an important innovation with big benefits for rangefinder photography. As a result, you can expect improved accuracy of the rangefinder-defined focus while the precise 10-blade aperture with 1/3 stop interval click stops ensures exact exposure."

Its immensely bright 600W COB LED output positions the 600d Pro as one of the brightest point source LEDs on the market. With only a 720W Max Power Draw, this light is able to approach the brightness of 1200W HMIs at only a fraction of their total energy consumption, allowing you to power more than one from a single household circuit.In addition, the 600d Pro takes advantage of the lower power consumption requirements of LEDs compared to hot lights, allowing it to draw power from both V & Gold Mount cinema batteries. Its multi-voltage battery plates make it compatible with 14.4V, 26V, and 28.8V batteries, for a wide variety of power options. The 600d Pro's battery plates also include revolutionary charging functionality, giving the LS 600d Pro the ability to refill batteries when plugged into AC power between scenes. The control box is also capable of accepting 48V (15A) DC power via 3-pin XLR, allowing it to be powered via external battery power stations or block batteries.The LS 600d Pro's weather-resistant design renders it capable of withstanding inclement weather conditions like light rain and water spray."

It's designed for your mirrorless camera, so it works in harmony with the autofocus and the digital image processing, and the E-mount connection clips in seamlessly. It has 18 elements that let it maintain a consistent f/2.8 aperture right through the zoom to give you rapid results even at 70mm. In addition, the extra-low dispersion glass reduces chromatic aberrations to eliminate distortion and discoloration, and the Nano AR coating eliminates unwanted reflections. Without modifications, this zoom lens can focus on objects as little as 15 inches away at 24mm, letting you get closer to the action, yet it's also ideal for portrait photography as it passes straight through the standard portrait range. While it's designed for full-frame cameras, it also works with APS-C E-mount cameras to produce a 35mm equivalent focal length of 36-105mm. When you're on the go, a zoom lock button prevents the lens from telescoping downward. Fast, quiet autofocus combines with manual focusing rings when needed so that you can control this Sony 24-70mm f/2.8 E-mount lens with ease. Sony FE 24-70mm F2.8 GM Standard Zoom Lens Featuring some of the most advanced lens technologies in the market today, the new FE 24-70mm F2.8 GM (model SEL2470GM) is the ultimate choice for those seeking the highest possible optical performance for portrait, travel and event photography or even simple everyday shooting."

        "product_descriptions": "Nikon D850 Digital Camera Overview:Proving that speed and resolution can indeed coexist, the Nikon D850 DSLR Camera is a multimedia DSLR that brings together robust stills capabilities along with apt movie and time-lapse recording. Revolving around a newly designed 45.7MP BSI CMOS sensor and proven EXPEED 5 image processor, the D850 is clearly distinguished by its high resolution for recording detailed imagery. The sensor is able to acquire greater detail and clarity when working in low-light conditions, and it forgoes an optical low-pass filter for improved sharpness. Working together with the sensor is the EXPEED 5 image processor, which together allow a 7 fps continuous shooting rate, a sensitivity range from ISO 32-102400, and 4K UHD video recording as well as an 8K time-lapse recording mode. Benefitting the imaging capabilities is an advanced Multi-CAM 20K 153-point AF system, which offers 99 cross-type sensors for refined focusing accuracy in a variety of lighting conditions. A large optical pentaprism offers a wide field of view and 0.75x magnification. A 3.2' LCD touchscreen aids with live view shooting, playback, menu navigation, and features a tilting design.Manufacturer Included Items:1 x EN-EL15a Lithium Battery1 x MH-25A Battery Charger1 x AN-DC18 Camera Strap1 x UC-E22 USB 3.0 Cable1 x Eyepiece & Body CapTHIS NIKON INTERNATIONAL CAMERA BUNDLE CONTAINS:1 x Nikon D850 DSLR Digital Camera (Body Only) (1585)1 x SanDisk 64GB Extreme Pro SD Memory Card2 x EN-EL15 Compatible Li-Ion Battery1 x Large Digital Camera Gadget Bag1 x HDMI to Mini HDMI Cable1 x Padded Hand Grip Strap1 x Remote Shutter Release1 x USB SD Card Reader1 x Memory Card Wallet1 x Deluxe Cleaning Kit"

The sensor and processor work together to enable high image quality with a wide dynamic range and high signal-to-noise ratio. These two technologies also combine to provide a wealth of speed throughout the D610, including a continuous shooting rate of 6 fps and a quiet shooting mode.A Multi-CAM 4800 AF sensor is integrated into the camera's design and produces fast autofocus speeds using a 39-point array to precisely acquire focus in a wide array of lighting conditions. When recording movies or working in live view, a contrast-detection focusing method works to continuously deliver accurate focus with subject-tracking and face-detection capabilities using the full-time servo mode. Full HD 1080p video is supported up to 30 fps in the MPEG-4 AVC/H.264 format and manual control over the ISO, shutter speed, and aperture is possible for optimized control over the look and feel of movies.Manufacturer Included Items:1 x Nikon EN-EL15 Lithium-Ion Battery Pack1 x Nikon MH-25 Quick Battery Charger1 x Nikon AN-DC10 Camera Strap1 x Nikon BF-1B Body Cap Cover1 x Nikon DK-21 Rubber EyecupTHIS NIKON INTERNATIONAL CAMERA BUNDLE CONTAINS:1 x Nikon D610 DSLR FX-Format Digital Camera (Body)1 x Nikon AF-S NIKKOR 18-140mm f/3.5-5.6G VR Lens1 x SanDisk 64GB Ultra SDHC SD Memory Card1 x EN-EL15 Compatible Lithium-Ion Battery1 x Large Digital SLR Camera Gadget Bag1 x 67mm Professional Telephoto Lens1 x 67mm 4-Piece Deluxe Filter Kit1 x 67mm Tulip Lens Hood1 x Lens Cap Keeper Strap1 x USB SD Card Reader1 x Memory Card Wallet1 x Deluxe Cleaning Kit"
