        "product_descriptions": "The Advanced VX \u00c2(AVX)sets a standard in mid-level telescopes, providing many of the features found on Celestron\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most sophisticated German equatorial mounts at an extremely affordable price. The Advanced VX 8\u00e2\u0080\u009d Schmidt Cassegrain telescope is ideal for imagers and visual observers looking for a telescope that is much more portable than the reflector or refractor. The 8\u00e2\u0080\u009d optical tube offers 84% more light gathering ability than a 6\u00e2\u0080\u009d telescope. The Schmidt-Cassegrain design also eliminates chromatic aberration, making it a good choice for astroimaging. The Advanced VX mount is designed to provide superior performance while taking advantage of Celestron\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most advanced technologies: All-Star Polar Alignment, Celestron PWI telescope control software, SkyAlign, and permanently programmable periodic error correction (PPEC). If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re an experienced imager, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll love taking this portable mount to a dark sky site and enjoying all the conveniences of a larger observatory mount. Or, if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re new to imaging,\u00c2 Advanced VX will help you get started with the hobby and keep up with your needs for years to come. Computerized German equatorial mount The Advanced VX is the smallest of Celestron\u00e2\u0080\u0099s German equatorial mounts. The computerized GoTo capability automatically tracks objects as they move across the night sky. The Advanced VX mount includes ports for a hand control, an autoguider, and 2 AUX ports for optional accessories.\u00c2 The NexStar+ hand control gives you instant access to all the functions your mount has to offer. With automatic slewing and menu descriptions, any level of astronomer can master this mount in just a few observing sessions. The Advanced VX also has an impressive tripod for its class with a 2\u00e2\u0080\u009d diameter steel tripod legs providing an extra-wide stance for improved stability. Payload capacity The payload capacity for the Advanced VX is 30 lb. It offers a sturdy platform for any of the Advanced VX optical tubes, even when paired with optional accessories like , StarSense AutoAlign , a Focus Motor , and a finderscope . Celestron's payload capacity does not include the weight of the counterweights.\u00c2 camera Dual saddle plateAs of early 2019, Advanced VX mounts include a dual saddle plate that accommodates both CG-5 and CGE-style dovetail. Switching between the two saddle plates is as simple as moving the hand knobs into a separate set of holes. You can use an Advanced VX mount with virtually any optical tube within its weight limit. Compatible with Vixen format dovetails 100mm or longer, not compatible with Losmandy D format plates (regardless of plate manufacturer). \u00c2 Software Celestron PWI Telescope Control Software Your Ultimate Astronomy Software Suite All current Celestron computerized telescopes include Celestron PWI (CPWI), the most advanced astronomy software suite provided with any consumer-grade telescope. Celestron\u00e2\u0080\u0099s experts co-developed CPWI with the engineers at PlaneWave Instruments. The result is an all-in-one solution offering you many of the same features used on PlaneWave\u00e2\u0080\u0099s observatory-class telescopes. Graphical planetarium interface with PointXP advanced mount modelling allows you to add 100+ points to your alignment model for the most accurate pointing and tracking possible Ideal for remote observatory setups: save and re-load your alignment and park your scope Provides a complete ASCOM telescope interface to allow control of the telescope from third party software applications For more information on CPWI and to see the user interface, click . here Starry Night SoftwareIncluded with your purchase is a free download of Celestron\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Starry Night Special Edition Software.

Now your superior optics can be used to capture high-definition stills and video of that rare bird or butterfly in your sight. Ergonomic handling and user-friendly functionality makes the ATX eyepiece an observer's delight. The eyepiece quickly attaches/detaches from the objective assembly's bayonet mount, making the scope easy to disassemble, transport, and store. Swarovski engineered the angled-view eyepiece's focus dial to precisely align with the zoom dial on the objective assembly, enabling one-handed adjustments to field of view and zoom. This feature is especially useful when tracking an object, requiring one hand to guide the tripod head. This eyepiece's generously wide viewing angle, extra-long eye relief, and click-stop twist-in eyecup makes using your ATX spotting scope a world-class glassing experience."

          "Expand creative horizons with the widest GF lens yet Offering a 35mm equivalent focal range of a 16-28mm lens, GF20-35mmF4 R LM WR brings the most popular wide-angle options to the GFX System, giving landscape, travel, and architecture photographers limitless options to be make use of the system's 1.7x larger than full frame sensor. It also has the added convenience of a constant F4 maximum aperture throughout its focal range, which ensures exposure consistency and fast, accurate autofocusing regardless of the focal length. With one lens fulfilling most wide-angle needs anyone would have, recording all the beauty the world has to offer is now certainly possible and within easy reach.",
          "Stunning results at every setting The optical construction of GF20-35mmF4 R WR comprises 14 elements in ten groups, including three aspherical, one ED aspherical and three ED elements, for effective control of distortion and chromatic aberration. As a result, the lens delivers high resolution images up to 100-megapixels with edge-to-edge sharpness at all focal lengths and aperture settings. Optical quality is further improved through the use of Fujifilm's unique Nano GI coating technology, which cuts down reflected light to reduce ghosting and flare, boosting sharpness, color and detail.",
          "The ideal traveling companion The compact design of GF20-35mmF4 R LM WR makes it easy to forget it's a large format zoom lens. Measuring just 112.5mm (4.4 inches) and weighing 725g (25.6 oz) it's perfect for carrying to any location and a great choice for creatives prepared to hike long distances to find the perfect location. Its internal zoom mechanism also makes for easy handling and ready to make memorable images. At the end of the day, GF20-35mmF4 may be similar to its full frame equivalent, but it is certainly More Than Full Frame when it comes to large format image quality.",
          "Fast AF and assured handling GF20-35mmF4 R WR uses an internal zoom mechanism, so its physical length and weight remain constant at every focal length. Minimal breathing throughout the range also ensures framing consistency, while a stepping motor delivers fast, near-silent autofocus down to 35cm (13.78in) so subjects are acquired quickly and without delay.",
          "Ready to create in all conditions Like all G Mount lenses, GF20-35mmF4 R WR features a weather-resistant design with 12 sealed points protecting the lens from dust and moisture, while also keeping it functioning in temperatures as low as -10C (14F). Furthermore, the front element features a fluorine coating, to repel water, fingerprints and other marks, ensuring creativity doesn't need to stop when the bad weather starts."
