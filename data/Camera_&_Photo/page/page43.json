The Siedentopf binocular mount has interchangeable pairs of WF10x and WF16x eyepieces with 55 to 75mm interpupillary adjustment, a fixed 45-degree vertical inclination to reduce eye and neck strain, and a 360-degree rotation capability to enable sharing. A Siedentopf binocular head enables the viewer to change the interpupillary distance without changing the tube length, eliminating the need to re-focus the image. Dioptric adjustment accommodates individual eye-strength differences. The forward-facing, ball-bearing driven triple nosepiece has 4x, 10x, and 40xS (spring) DIN strain-free plan achromatic objectives. Strain-free objectives are optimized for use with polarized light, and plan achromatic objectives provide color correction and focus over the entire viewing field. The 40xS objective is spring loaded to prevent slide damage when focusing. Polarizing microscopes are used in geology, petrology, mineralogy, toxicology, pharmacology, forensics, and industrial inspection applications to view and measure birefringence of anisotropic materials, including organic compounds, water, minerals, and rocks. The microscope has polarizing and Brightfield illumination with a selection knob to choose between illumination types. The built-in Bertrand lens has a rotating disc with centering controls, and 90-degree rotation with 1-degree graduations. The polarizer, analyzer, and Bertrand lens can be removed from the optical path to use the microscope as a Brightfield microscope. Transmitted 20W halogen illumination has a rheostat to control light intensity, and provides bright light in a concentrated path. The 1.25 NA Abbe condenser is mounted on a steel rack-and-pinion control system and can be adjusted to control the distance of the light from the stage. An iris diaphragm optimizes the amount of light illuminating the specimen. The round 160mm diameter floating stage has 360-degree rotation on a ball-bearing movement, and a 28mm vertical travel range. The stage is graduated in 1-degree increments and is equipped with a vernier scale for greater precision, which allows retardation measurements to be made with a minimum resolution of 6 minutes of arc. It has a locking screw to secure the stage location, detachable slide clips, and a stain-resistant finish. Nested coaxial coarse and fine focus has tension-adjustable coarse focusing and an adjustable lock ring stopper that limits stage range to protect slides and objectives from damage. All-metal mechanical parts, solid-metal frame construction, and a stain-resistant enamel finish provide durability. Microscopes are instruments used to enhance the resolution of an object or image. Types include compound, stereo, or digital. Compound microscopes use a compound optical system with an objective lens and an eyepiece. Stereo microscopes show object depth in a three-dimensional image. Digital microscopes are used to display an image on a monitor, rather than looking through a lens. Microscopes can have monocular (one), binocular (two), or trinocular (three) eyepieces, with varying magnification abilities. Magnification ability refers to the size of an image. Resolution, also known as resolvant power, refers to the clarity of the image. The interaction between field of view (FOV), numerical aperture (NA), and working distance (WD) determines resolution. Microscopes can control magnification through a fixed focus, or through a range of adjustments. They can also utilize LED, fluorescent, and mirror light sources to help control viewing capabilities. Microscopes are widely used in education, lab research, biology, metallurgy, engineering, chemistry, manufacturing, and in the medical, forensic science, and veterinary industries. United Scope manufactures microscopy equipment and accessories under the brand name AmScope. The company, founded in 1996, is headquartered in Irvine, CA."

Aperture blades 9 The lens fogs up in hot or cold environments The lens may fog up if the camera is moved from one temperature extreme to the other. In most cases, this occurs when you go from a very cold environment to a very warm one, but it can also happen when you switch from a very warm environment to a very cold one. To correct fogging, remove the battery and storage media in a low humidity environment. Leave all media, battery, and port covers open to allow moisture trapped inside to evaporate. Let the camera stand for about an hour, or until it reaches the same temperature as the environment.IMPORTANT- Do not open media, battery, and port covers in high humidity or near water to prevent lens fogging. With interchangeable lenses, moisture can accumulate inside the lens and camera if the air is dry on the inside and humid on the outside. Do not change the object in high humidity environments.

Create dazzling full-frame images rivaled only by Nikon's D800 series D-SLR and 1080p Full HD videos. Nikon's superior 39-point AF system and Scene Recognition System means details will be clear and crispfor static or moving subjects. HD video quality rivals more expensive dedicated video cameras. Nikon FX-format quality has never been more attainable. The power of a pro-level Nikon FX-format cameradazzling full-frame images, broadcast-quality 1080p video at your fingertips, superior low-light performance, faster frame rate up to 6 frames-per-second (fps), tack sharp autofocus with 39 focus points, built-in flash with Commander Mode, wireless photo sharing and much moreis attainable in a compact, lightweight full-frame HD-SLR body. A new continuous quiet mode lets you capture a sequence of shots without the noise associated with the raising and lowering of the D-SLR's mirror. Optimized for full-frame shooting, streamlined for compactness and value, the D610 will fuel your photographic passion like never before. Passionate photographers who seek uncompromised full-frame, high-resolution performance rely on Nikon FX-format HD-SLRs. With a level of performance only bested by Nikon's own D800 series D-SLRs, D610's 24.3 megapixel FX-format CMOS sensor, wide dynamic range and high S/N (signal-to-noise) ratio captures every detail with lifelike sharpness and low noise throughout its wide ISO range. Low-light performance is synonymous with Nikonshoot crystal clear images from ISO 100 to 6400, expandable down to 50 and up to 25,600 for extreme situations. EXPEED 3 processing system manages all that data with remarkable speed and accuracy, enabling up to 6 fps continuous shooting at full resolution in both FX and DX formats. Whether shooting people, landscapes or close-upsyou'll marvel at D610's faithful color reproduction. Add Nikon's newest selection of affordable fast f/1.8 primes, compact wide ratio zooms with VR image stabilization or tele- and supertelephoto lenses and you'll see the full potential that the D610 offers. One of the keys to capturing razor-sharp images is a fast, precise autofocus system, and the D610 has one of the best. 39 tightly packed focus points with wide-area AF coverage offer endless compositional possibilities. Nine cross-type sensors in the center offer superior accuracy even when light and contrast are scarce. Seven center focus points work all the way down to f/8 for extended AF functionality with teleconverters and long-reach lenses. Switch between 9, 21 or 39 point AF, allowing for compositional freedom. D610's Scene Recognition System's subject identification and tracking information means enhanced performance by 3D Tracking and Auto Area AF. When shooting photos or HD video in Live View, Nikon's responsive contrast-detect AF activates for accurate fulltime autofocusing. The D610 delivers consistently beautiful images, thanks to Nikon's intelligent Scene Recognition System with 3D Color Matrix Metering II. Its 2,016 pixel RGB sensor evaluates every scene, taking into account brightness, contrast, subject distance and the scene colors, all within the time it takes to press the shutter release button. That data is then referenced against an onboard image database for consistently accurate exposures, auto white balance, i-TTL flash and subject-tracking autofocus performance.  Nikon is committed to developing HD-SLRs that empower and inspire filmmakers and video enthusiasts, and the D610 is proof of that. Shoot 1080p HD videos with selectable frame rates of 30p, 25p or 24p and MPEG-4 AVC/H.264 compression. Bend time with 720p HD at 60p, 50p or 30p for ultra-smooth video playback of fast moving subjects, or create slow-motion footage during post processing. Manually adjust ISO, shutter speed and aperture, activate Live View shooting's fulltime AF with face-priority and subject tracking or manually focus. Experience dedicated inputs for an optional stereo mic and headphones for monitoring sound, still image exporting, uncompressed recording of video via HDMI out to an external recorder, simultaneous live view on external monitors and much more. Multi-area mode Full HD D-Movie gives you compositional freedom using FX or DX movie formats. Enhance your video with the dramatic perspectives and depth-of-field control of Nikon's full line of NIKKOR interchangeable lenses, and you'll dazzle with every video project. With Wi-Fi compatibility, sharing photos is easier than ever. Connect the optional WU-1b Wireless Mobile Adapter and wirelessly transfer photos to your smartphone, tablet or any compatible Wi-Fi enabled device. Use your smartphone to instantly upload your shots to the web or email them to a friend. Install Nikon's free Wireless Mobile Adapter Utility and remotely control the D610and shoot from your smartphone or tablet! The D610's built-in pop-up flash offers up new shooting possibilities that other cameras simply can't matchand not just in low-light situations. Even well lit subjects can benefit from a balanced fill flash for extra depth and dimension. And since the D610's flash integrates with Nikon's i-TTL system, it can act as a Commander and communicate crucial exposure information to two groups of remote flashes across three channels for accurate lighting and exceptional results. When you need the extra power, add an optional accessory Nikon Speedlight for more lighting possibilities. "
