Imaging performance is in no way compromised by the camera's diminutive proportions. Instead, X-T5's improved image processing algorithm delivers outstanding results, packed with detail right across the native ISO range, which now extends to ISO 125.The classic X Series design has been retained. Dials predominate, making key functions - including ISO, shutter speed and exposure compensation - quick and easy to set, even with the camera switched off. X-T5 is also comparable in size"
