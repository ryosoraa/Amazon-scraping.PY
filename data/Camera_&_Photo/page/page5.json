At the heart of the EOS R3 is a Canon developed 24.1 megapixel back-illuminated stacked CMOS sensor which combines with the DIGIC X processor to deliver a higher speed readout, allowing for continuous blackout-free shooting** at up to 30 fps in electronic (silent) shutter mode with minimum rolling distortion. The combination also increases the high sensitivity light capturing efficiency of a native ISO of 102400 for still images. The improved Dual Pixel CMOS AF II with 1,053 AF Points features evolved EOS iTR tracking for subjects such as people, animals, as well as select cars and motorcycles*** down to EV -7.5. The EOS R3 also allows the user multiple ways of controlling AF using Eye Control AF, Smart Controller with home position and the classic multi-controller. The camera also includes a new multi-function hot shoe which alleviates the need for extra batteries and cables in accessories such as micro phones and flash transmitters. The EOS R3 also includes flexible connectivity options with built-in wired LAN, GPS, USB, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. The Canon EOS R3 is designed to satisfy the most demanding expectations in a camera  emphasizing speed, performance, and reliability."

Leave your tripod at home when you use the new Canon 15x50 binoculars. Canon has once again made its world-renowned optical image stabilizer more convenient to use on this all-weather binocular. With a push of a button, bumpy images are stabilized instantly for maximum viewing. Multicoated ultralow dispersion (UD) objective elements add contrast, clarity, and color fidelity. Housed in a rugged, water-resistant, and slip-free rubber body, these binoculars can be used in rain or shine, whether in a football stadium or on the high seas. Stargazing is also possible with these versatile binoculars. The 15x50 is greatly improved over the previous model, with a larger 50mm objective lens, more convenient operation of the optical image stabilizer, and optional antifog eyepieces. Two AA batteries power the device. Also included in the package are a case, neck strap, and eyepiece covers. Image Stabilization and More With any high magnification binoculars, most users will experience frustrating image shake. Unless fixed to a tripod, image shake can render high magnification binoculars useless. Canon's IS technology is remarkably effective at eliminating this problem and is widely used by the television industry with Canon's professional broadcast quality video recording equipment. A special VAP (Vari-Angle Prism) corrective IS system sits between the objective lens group and the porro prism on each side of the binoculars. Within thousandths of a second of the binoculars being moved from their optical axis by vibrations, a detection system activates the IS mechanism. The VAP shape alters to refract or 'bend' the light path by precisely the right amount, thus fully compensating for the vibration. It is this essentially immediate response that effectively suppresses image shake. Super Spectra Coating A number of optical factors affect the brightness of an image, including the amount of incidental light that is reflected by the lens. An uncoated lens will refelect away as much as 8% of the incidentail light, significantly dimming the image. Canon's Super Spectra Coating prevents that reflection. What do the numbers mean? 15x50? 8x25? The two numbers used to describe any pair of binoculars are their magnification  8x, 12x, 15x and so on  and the diameter of their objective lenses  25mm, 36mm, 50mm, and so on. The larger the first number is, the larger the object will appear to be in the objective lens. For instance, if you use a 10x lens and look at an object that is 100 yards away, it appears to be the same size as an object located just 10 yards away. The second number, the size of the objective lens, is important because the larger the objective lens, the more light it can admit for brighter, more detailed images, and the better suited they will be for lowlight situations.

Ideal for astrophotography, architecture, landscape, and even portraits and movie shooting, it delivers extraordinary resolution and gorgeous bokeh with precision focus performance. Two XA (extreme aspherical) elements, one aspherical, two ED (Extra-low Dispersion) glass and one Super ED element coupled with Nano AR coating II all contribute to high-contrast, high-resolution results with corner-to-corner sharpness and dramatically reduce chromatic aberration, flare and ghosting.",
          "F1.8 max 9-blade circular aperture maximizes the beauty of this large-aperture prime-lens, contributing to impressive images in which the subject stands out against a smoothly defocused foreground and background, as well as perfectly round points of defocused light. One Super ED (Extra-low Dispersion) and two ED glass elements significantly reduce flare and ghosting by taking axial chromatic aberration and chromatic aberration (due to differences in magnification) out of the picture. Resolution and bokeh is maximized while leaving precisely rendered edges with no fringing or unnatural coloration right out to the image edges.",

Unprecedented resolution and other demanding design parameters yield outstanding reproduction of the most detailed subjects and scenes with superior contrast throughout every frame. G Master resolution is simply the highest in its class.Previously unattainable surface precisionBuilt with three aspherical elements including a newly developed and essential ingredient for astonishing resolution  is a new XA (extreme aspherical) lens element with better that 0.01micron surface precision. The extremely precise XA element reduces aberration and delivers the ultimate resolution throughout the entire zoom range and aperture range, as well as from corner to corner of all image files.Constant F1.4 max aperture maintains exposure and depth of fieldConstant F1.4 max aperture maintains exposure and depth of field regardless of the focal range you choose to zoom to. When changing your aperture to defocus the background, the areas out of the focal plane appear blurred. This \u2018bokeh' effect of the blurred background can be enhanced with circular aperture blades used in this lens.11blade circular aperture contributes to gorgeous bokehComplementing the performance of the XA element are the first 11blade circular aperture ever implemented in an a lens, and exacting spherical aberration adjustment for each individual lens. The result is enchantingly softedged bokeh that is a hallmark of the Sony G Master series.When changing your aperture to defocus the background, the light sources appear blurred. This \u2018bokeh' effect of the blurred background can be enhanced with circular aperture blades used in this lens."

Weighing just 491g (1.08 lb), with a deep handgrip that ensures a confident, comfortable hold with even the most sizable lens attached. X-S20 delivers stunning 26.1 megapixel images straight out of camera using Fujifilm's acclaimed color science, at up to 20fps in electronic shutter mode. Its 180 Vari-Angle LCD touchscreen makes selfie-style shots or wild angles a snap and intuitive layout enables creatives of any level to create as soon as their hands touch the camera.",
          "X-S20 combines powerful sensor and processor technologies to deliver a blistering performance for stills and videoallowing you to capture the moment any way you need. For the first time in an X-S series model, the X-Trans CMOS 4 sensor is paired with the X-Processor 5 imaging engine, resulting in high-speed image and video processing alongside improved autofocus speed and accuracy. A new AF algorithm offers the same subject detection functionality as the range-topping X-H2S so you can move as fast as the world around you. X-S20 also features Auto Subject Detection AF, perfect for hassle-free creativity.",
          "Thoughtful ergonomics and cutting-edge technology make camera shake and blurry imagery a distant memory with X-S20. The camera's large handgrip makes for a secure hold. At the same time, five-axis in-body image stabilization (IBIS) has been improved, offering up to seven stops of compensation, ensuring that handheld videography and low-light image-making are nothing to fear. The X-S20 represents a one-stop gain over the previous IBIS system found in the X-S10.",
          "As well as being a competent stills machine, X-S20 excels at video creation  whether vlogging, live streaming, or making full-length features. The new Vlog mode puts professional-quality footage in easy reach, enabling users to focus on products while unboxing or defocus cluttered backgrounds with a tap. A 3.5mm jack makes it effortless to connect accessories, including the optional TG-BT1 grip can be added for hands-free wireless operation. Stream 4K/60P footage directly from USB-C*, or internally record up to 6.2K/30p video in 4:2:2 10-bit color when story calls for it.",
          "X-S20's upgraded battery significantly enhances longevity, letting creatives create content on the go with less concern about battery life. Its NP-W235 Li-ion battery delivers an impressive 750 frames in Normal mode  more than twice the number possible with the previous model.
