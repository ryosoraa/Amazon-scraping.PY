An Art-series zoom, this lens is also distinguished by its fast f/2.8 constant maximum aperture to suit working in available lighting conditions. Featuring a sophisticated optical design, a series of low dispersion and aspherical elements is used to minimize both chromatic and spherical aberrations throughout the zoom range in order to achieve high sharpness, clarity, and color accuracy. A Super Multi-Layer Coating combined with a Nano Porous Coating also helps to suppress lens flare and ghosting to a greater degree than conventional anti-reflective coatings. This helps to more effectively produce color-accuracy and contrast-rich imagery in a variety of lighting conditions. Though full-time manual focus is available, this lens is equipped with a stepping motor that enables smooth, high-speed autofocusing that is notably quiet whether utilizing features such as Face/Eye Detection AF or during video shooting. A built-in Autofocus-Lock (AFL) button can be assigned additional functions to widen the range of operations available on the lens, while inside, a rounded 11-blade diaphragm improves image quality by helping to create smooth bokeh. Additionally, a built-in lens hood serves to protect the front element as well as prevent stray light from causing flare.In the Box:Sigma 14-24mm f/2.8 DG DN Art Lens for Sony ELC850-01 Front CapSigma Rear Cap LCR II for Sony E Mount LensesLens Case"

Revolving around a full-frame 42.4MP Exmor R BSI CMOS sensor and updated BIONZ X image processor, the a7R III affords an impressive 10 fps continuous shooting rate along with improved autofocus performance for faster, more reliable subject tracking along with wide frame coverage. This updated Fast Hybrid AF System employs a combination of 399 phase-detection points and 425 contrast-detection areas for quicker acquirement of focus in a variety of lighting conditions, and also maintains focus on subjects more effectively. In addition to speed and AF, the processing improvements also help to realize greater image clarity throughout the sensitivity range from ISO 100-32000, which can further be expanded to ISO 50-102400. Video recording capabilities have also been extended for enhanced quality when recording UHD 4K video with the full width of the full-frame sensor, or when using a Super35 area and 5K oversampling to minimize moir and aliasing.In The Box:Sony Alpha a7R III Mirrorless Digital Camera (Body Only)NP-FZ100 Rechargeable Lithium-Ion Battery (2280mAh)BC-QZ1 Battery ChargerCable ProtectorShoulder StrapALC-B1EM Body Cap for E-Mount CamerasAccessory Shoe CapEyepiece CapUSB Type-C CableBundle Items:1 x Sony Alpha a7R III Mirrorless Digital Camera1 x Lens Cleaning Solution1 x Blower Brush1 x Microfiber Cloth1 x Lens Tissue Paper1 x 5pc Cotton Swabs1 x High Quality Dust Cleaner Blower1 x Lens Pen Cleaner1 x Lens Cap Keeper1 x Microfiber Cloth"

With a newly developed high-refraction glass prism, the viewfinder provides a wide field of view equivalent to that of a full-frame SLR, fully immersing the photographer in shooting. It features a high-performance, five-axis shake-reduction (SR) system and the innovative Pixel Shift Resolution System.The camera's PENTAX Real-time Scene Analysis System, supported by the latest artificial intelligence technology, assists the camera in optimizing exposure settings and improving autofocusing accuracy, assuring more accurate subject detection and more reliable scene judgment.The high-definition 3.2-inch touch-screen LCD monitor-the first touch screen in the PENTAX K series, improves efficiency and operability. Its compact, rugged dustproof and weather resistant body makes it suitable for use in the most extreme environmental conditions.Optical viewfinder with nearly 100% field of view and approximately 1.05-times magnificationThe PENTAX K-3 Mark III features an optical viewfinder with a nearly 100-percent field of v"

        "product_descriptions": " this Real-Time Proxy Transfer mode enables remote control of key camera functions and transfer of proxy files. Using Canon's CameraAccess application, live video images can be viewed and/or recorded as MP4 proxy data and other operations controlled from a compatible smartphone or tablet device allowing news footage, for example, to be distributed and backed up. MP4 proxy files recorded on the compatible smartphone or tablet can be used to check material being captured at the remote location, and for news-flash footage. Live or recorded images can also be output via the camcorder's HD-SDI connectors. The XF200 professional camcorder features a highly versatile Genuine Canon 20x HD Video Lens that captures superb images with outstanding clarity at 900 TV lines of resolution. Offering a 35mm equivalent zoom of 26.8-576 mm, the optical zoom lens provides an extended range that can prove ideal for wide-angle to extreme telephoto shooting. When compared to previous XF professional camcorder models, the XF200's flexible focal range and enhanced wide angle offer many creative options, even when working at a distance. An eight-blade circular aperture provides a natural and visually pleasing bokeh effect to out of focus highlights.In addition, the XF200 features three separate, banked lens rings that provide independent control of critical focus, zoom and iris/aperture settings, with adequate separation to improve ease of use. Separate gain and white-balance toggle switches are provided. Also, the camera's zoom speed is now up to 1.8x faster than the XF105/XF100 professional camcorders, with three selectable zoom speeds for creative control. The XF200 professional camcorder features an Autofocus system with several useful modes, including Instant AF, which uses both the TTL Video Signal Detection System and the external sensor, and Face Detection AF, which tracks the focus on any faces in the video frame, even if that subject is in profile. Also, a Minimum Object Distance (MOD) of just 23.6 inches is maintained at all zoom levels from wide angle to telephoto, enabling flexible framing control even when shooting close-ups. The XF200 professional camcorder's new Five-Axis Dynamic Super Range OIS system combines optical and electronic correction to help reduce image distortion- even when shooting while walking - for better looking videos. Standard Mode uses lens shift to provide constant compensation throughout the zoom range. Powered Mode helps improve vibration suppression at telephoto focal lengths. Dynamic Mode is specifically designed to stabilize the image when walking and shooting handheld by correcting simultaneously for roll, yaw and pitch. The XF200 professional camcorder features an aluminum die-cast grip that can be rotated through a wide 120-degree angle in discrete 15-degree steps. Cinematographers and other operators can maintain a firm and comfortable hold of the camera at any shooting angle. The XF200 professional camcorder features both a newly developed color viewfinder and a precision OLED panel. The tiltable, 0.45-inch viewfinder offers 1.23-megapixel resolution for improved visual display, making it possible to accurately check focus, framing, exposure, white balance and other camera settings. A wide, 28.2-degree viewing angle and high-definition imaging provide a comfortable shooting environment.The 3.5-inch, touch-sensitive 1.23-megapixel Organic Electroluminescence (OLED) panel offers a number of user advantages over conventional backlit LCD-type displays, including a high contrast ratio, a wide viewing angle, high-speed response, slim dimensions and light weight. Special recording modes can expand the range that visual images can express. Both slow- and fast-motion recording in MXF format is possible using the XF200 professional camcorder's pair of Compact Flash drives, at speeds up to 250% and down to 40% of real time. Such special effects can be perfect for such feature productions as music videos and wedding videos. In addition to dual-frequency Wi-Fi links, the XF200 professional camcorder features an Ethernet connector for quickly linking the camcorder to conventional wired local-area networks and wireless routers, thus enabling browser preview during shoots, in addition to FTP transfer of video files to an external PC or laptop. Browser-enabled remote control is also supported by connecting to a wireless router via Ethernet. The XF200 professional camcorder accommodates two- or four-channel recording of high-quality linear PCM audio sound at 16-bit/48 kHz sampling rate with individual level controls. Four-channel mode during MXF-format video recording enables a reporter's lavaliere microphone to be captured on one channel, for example, and the interviewee's mic on another channel, with two-channel ambience from the camera's built-in stereo microphone on channels 3 and 4. In addition, separate volume controls for the two XLR inputs enable the same source to be recorded at a lower level as backup."
