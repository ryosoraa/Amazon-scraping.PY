Utilizing a proven and well-regarded APS-C-format 26.1MP X-Trans CMOS 4 sensor, the X100V is capable of high-resolution recording along with support for DCI/UHD 4K video, sensitivity from ISO 160-12800, and continuous shooting up to 11 fps with the mechanical shutter. The BSI design of the sensor affords reduced noise and greater overall clarity and is paired with the X-Processor 4 to achieve fast performance and improved responsiveness. The sensor's design also enables a hybrid autofocus system that combines 425 phase-detection points with a contrast-detection system for quick and accurate AF performance. Beyond imaging, the X100V retains the tried-and-true rangefinder-inspired body design that has made this series of cameras so special. The popular Advanced Hybrid Viewfinder is used once again but has been updated with a higher resolution 3.69m-dot OLED EVF for clearer viewing. This can still be flicked away to reveal a clear 0.52x-magnification optical finder to suit the purists' way of photographing. Complementing the finder is a 3.0' 1.62m-dot LCD touchscreen, which features a two-way tilting design to support working from both high and low angles.

It features an impressive 45-point all cross-type AF system that provides high-speed, highly precise AF in virtually any kind of light. In dim lighting, it has improved low luminance performance to EV -3 and is compatible with most EF lenses (lenses with maximum apertures of f/8 or higher, and some lenses with extenders attached may operate at a maximum of 27 points). It also features 4 types of AF area selection modes useful for a number of different AF situations. To help ensure photographers don't miss their shot, an Intelligent Viewfinder with approximately 100% coverage provides a clear view and comprehensive image data. Approximately 100% coverage means there's virtually no guesswork when it comes to composition, and with all settings available at a glance, the Intelligent Viewfinder helps photographers keep their eye on their subject, so the image can be captured at the right instant. The powerful 24.2 Megapixel (APS-C) CMOS sensor and Dual Pixel CMOS AF for Live View shooting enhance the EOS 80D's performance across the board. Complementing the EOS 80D's advanced operation are built-in wireless connectivity and Full HD 60p movies that can be saved as MP4s for easy sharing. Merging power, precision and operability, the EOS 80D is a dynamic SLR camera for anyone ready to realize their creative vision."

        "product_descriptions": "Untitled 1This is the world's first consumer-grade probe lens which focuses from 2:1 macro to infinity and with a compelling wide angle 'Bug Eye' perspective. The wide angle design means much more depth of field at close distance than conventional telephoto macro lens so that more background details can now be seen. The front barrel of the lens is designed to be waterproof and a LED ring light is mounted at the tip of the lens. It can cover both standard 35mm full frame & Super35 image sensor and it is super light to carry.Bug Eye PerspecitveMacro lenses in the market tend to have a long focal length (from 60mm to 120mm) and the subject fills most of the frame, isolating it from the surrounding environment. Our Laowa 24mm, instead, allows you to focus really close (2cm @ 2:1) to the subject, showing a great amount of detail and texture. But at the same time, you can enjoy a compelling wide angle 'Bug Eye' view (84.1) ' so that more background details can then be included in the shots. You can easily create a very informative and stunning macro bug-eye perspective that no other lenses can do. The fact that it can focus really close to the subject enables a lot of shooting possibility.2:1 Macro to Infinity FocusAs macro photographers ourselves, we usually face the problem of not being able to shoot smaller subjects. With our Laowa probe, you can now take advantage of the 2:1 maximum magnification to shoot really small bugs and reveal detail s that cannot be seen by naked eye. It is particularly useful for videography as both finer details and environmental background can be captured in one shot.Deep Depth Of FieldThe wide angle design also means much more depth of field at close distance (compared to the telephoto macro lens) so that more background details can now be seen. Being able to focus so close but still having a deep depth of field is a BIG advantage for both studio and wildlife shooting.Long & Tubular Lens barrelDo not understand this weird design?"
