Even when extended to the 500mm telephoto end, the lens is still compact enough for comfortable handheld shooting. This zoom lets users enjoy casual shooting with steady performance and high image quality in the ultra-telephoto realm where conventional wisdom once dictated a tripod. To support handheld shooting in the ultra-telephoto range, the 150-500mm is equipped with VXD (Voice-coil eXtreme-torque Drive), a linear motor focus mechanism that delivers excellent quietness and agile performance, and TAMRON's proprietary VC (Vibration Compensation) mechanism for high-level image stabilization. At the 150mm end, the lens offers an MOD (Minimum Object Distance) of 23.6 for powerful and dramatic close-ups."

          "DECLICK FEATURE: One completely new feature of the Loxia lens is that you can 'declick' the aperture's locking mechanism using a tool (supplied) and an adjustment screw on the bayonet surface. This means that for video applications, you can smoothly eliminate any unwanted differences in brightness as you pan the camera. This feature can also be used with other video systems whose size makes them suitable for adaption.",
          "IMMENSELY COMPATIBLE: The ZEISS Loxia lenses are suitable for use with the mirrorless Sony Alpha cameras with E-mount and were optimized for sensors up to full 35 mm format (24 x 36 mm). With the ZEISS Loxia lenses, the aperture is controlled manually. This allowed the integration of the so-called DeClick feature of the mechanical aperture ring. The cameras feature the corresponding automatic exposure control (A) and manual exposure control (M).",
          "HIGH-GRADE FULL-METAL CASING: Tangible quality that holds its value is what qualifies ZEISS lenses for decades of hard use. A precision-engineered full-metal casing, grippy focus and aperture rings made of metal, and a tough front bayonet and filter screw guarantee stunning photographic results. A special sealing ring on the bayonet also protects the interface between the camera and the lens.",
          "VIRTUALLY DISTORTION-FREE OPTICS: Dramatic perspectives and a view from extraordinary image angles - ZEISS lenses open up new composition possibilities. Distortion would disrupt the composition because straight lines, whose image does not go through the image center, would be reproduced with a curved shape. This annoying effect is accordingly and largely compensated through elaborate optical designs at all focal lengths.",
          "PRECISE MANUAL FOCUS: Manually focusing a lens means controlling the image result from your fingertips. A good ergonomic design makes all the difference. ZEISS lenses stand out with their large rotation angle which enables precise focusing. Changes are immediately visible in the viewfinder. The high-quality focusing mechanism moves smoothly without play, thus also supporting the intuitive interaction with the focal plane. The precise engraving in meter and feet, and the depth of focus scale provide additional support for manually focusing."

        "product_descriptions": "Our AZ-EQ5 hybrid mount epitomizes Sky-Watcher's commitment to innovation. Part AZ mount, part equatorial, the AZ-EQ5 is Sky-Watcher's most versatile mount, capable of aligning in either Alt-Az, Equatorial or dual-OTA mode. Thanks to it's flexibility, the AZ-EQ5 mount is perfect for the beginning astronomer looking to get into astrophotography, the seasoned astrophotography buff or educators passionate about astronomy outreach. Unique to Sky-Watcher's AZ-EQ5 is a patented dual-encoder motor system, Freedom-Find , which allows users to move the mount manually without losing alignment. While most mounts lose their alignment once moved by hand, the AZ-EQ5 uses a proprietary slip clutch system that keeps your alignment whether you slew by hand or using the hand controller. After moving to the new object (electronically or manually), the mount will start tracking automatically. Using our proprietary SynScan hand controller, the AZ-EQ5 provides a user-friendly interface with automatic slewing to over 42, 000 objects in the night sky. The hand controller also connects to a computer using a USB connection (cable sold separately), enabling computer control with most astronomy programs, including SkyX, Stellarium and Starry Nights. Sky-Watcher's belt drive system has a few advantages over mounts using traditional stepper gearing. Belt drive systems deliver nearly silent slewing and tracking, making for an evening free of obnoxious motor noises while delivering spot on accuracy. Sky-Watcher's belt drive also features minimal backlash, smoother tracking, and less periodic error than mounts using traditional worm gears. For the astrophotographers looking to reduce Periodic Error, the SynScan hand controller has built in PEC training that can be configured while in the field! Periodic Error is best described as tiny back-and-forth oscillations of target stars. This motion is not notable during visual observation, but during a long photographic exposure, can turn pinpoint stars to small streaks. Using Sky-Watcher's built-in PEC training, astrophotographers can cut down on the problems caused by Periodic Error to get smoother tracking and better performance from an autoguider. The AZ-EQ5 mount has built in DSLR interface with the ability to control two cameras at once. Using a built-in intervelometer timer, the SynScan hand controller can set-up exposure length, and trigger the camera automatically. Additionally, the SynScan hand controller has the ability to select up to 8 different exposure combinations. No need to purchase an expensive cable release when Sky-Watcher includes everything you'll need to start shooting deep sky objects out of the box. Thanks to the pier extension that sits between the mount head and tripod, the AZ-EQ5 can be polar aligned at almost any latitude. Most equatorial mounts have difficulty with polar alignment at lower latitudes due to the counterweight bar interfering with the tripod. The AZ-EQ5 bypasses this completely, using a sturdy pier extension to elevate the mount head away from the tripod legs. The pier extension creates enough clearance between the counterweight bar and tripod legs that the mount can be polar aligned at virtually any latitude, from Alaska to Ecuador to Tierra del Fuego. In addition to the SynScan hand controller and the pier tripod, the AZ-EQ5 mount comes with two 7. 5lb counterweights and a counterweight extension bar, as well as an extra saddle for mounting a second scope for viewing in dual-OTA mode. The mount also includes two Canon EOS trigger cables for connecting your camera to the mount (Nikon and Sony cables available separate). A polar finderscope is also included to assist with setup. The AZ-EQ5 has a built in USB port for firmware updates, but also allows computer control using various astronomy software."

As a professional Light Storm fixture, the LS 1200d Pro utilizes a weather-resistant construction to withstand inclement weather. Its connectivity is also designed with lighting technicians in mind. The 1200d Pro uses LumenRadio CRMX and Art-net & sACN via an etherCON connector, in addition to the 5-Pin DMX512 ports, to seamlessly integrate into any professional DMX interface. The LS 1200d Pro also makes battery operation possible for high output fixtures by integrating two 48V/15A DC inputs for half or full power so that users can operate the 1200d Pro without noisy generators. The Light Storm 1200d Pro is ideal for filmmakers who need a high-output modifiable light fixture that also features a wide range of control & connectivity options, weather-resistant build quality, and the ability to operate using DC battery power. Integrating the LS 1200d Pro into onset workflows with CRMX or sACN, with its combination of HMI-level output, multiple reflector options, and Bowens Mount compatibility, gives filmmakers an incredibly bright fixture that already works within their existing ecosystems and smooth dimming control without color shift or the need to use scrims to decrease output."
