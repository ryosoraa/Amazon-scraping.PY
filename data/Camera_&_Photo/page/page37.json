Proven highly effective in Canon video camcorders and professional lenses, this revolutionary system employs a novel Vari-Angle Prism that instantly and continuously makes adjustments to maintain a steady image. With Canon Optical Image Stabilizer, you can enjoy the resolving power of these binoculars without a tripod. You can even use them from within moving vehicles. Their shake-free performance not only enhances your ability to view fine detail but also reduces eye strain and fatigue. The IS series feature eyepiece lenses with a unique Doublet Field Flattener, which dramatically reduces curvature of field. As a result, there is none of the image distortion and blurring at the periphery typical of high-magnification binoculars. This advanced design also results in long eye relief, which enables eyeglass wearers to view the entire field without vignetting.Canon superior optical engineering also provides unusually wide apparent field-of view. This is particularly important in high-magnification binoculars as it makes it easier to locate your desired subject."

S-Cinetone and S-Log3 Profiles: The camera features S-Cinetone, Sony's cinematic color profile, which provides beautiful skin tones and a film-like aesthetic straight out of the camera. Additionally, filmmakers can leverage S-Log3 for maximum dynamic range and color grading flexibility. Built-in Image Stabilization: The FX3 incorporates 5-axis in-body image stabilization (IBIS) technology, which effectively compensates for camera shake and provides smooth footage even when shooting handheld or in challenging conditions. Compact and Ergonomic Design: Sony designed the FX3 with a compact form factor and enhanced ergonomics to ensure comfortable handling during long shooting sessions. It includes dual media slots, XLR audio inputs, and various customizable buttons and controls for a seamless shooting experience.
