        "product_descriptions": "Continuing on in their legacy of powerful workhorse cameras, Canon has released the 5D Mark IV DSLR which is an outstanding still photography option and an able 4K-capable video machine. This multimedia maven offers a newly developed 30.4MP full-frame CMOS sensor paired with the DIGIC 6+ image processor in order to balance fine detail and resolution with low-light performance and sensitivity. It is able to work within a native range of ISO 100-32000, which can then be expanded to an impressive ISO 50-102400, for sharp, low-noise images in a variety of conditions. Along with these improvements to image quality, users will enjoy a performance boost across the board with an enhanced AF system, built-in Wi-Fi, NFC, and GPS, and much more.In order to deliver detailed images quickly and effectively the 5D Mark IV leverages the power of the DIGIC 6+ image processor, which can handle up to 7 frames per second during continuous shooting. It also uses a 150,000-pixel RGB+IR metering sensor to evaluate the scene and subjects for accurate exposures under a variety of different lighting conditions. An improved 61-point High Density Reticular AF furthers the camera's speed by tracking and locking onto subjects quickly and accurately for tack sharp photos. A new AF area select button is now available as well for near immediate access to this setting.Video benefits from the addition of Dual Pixel CMOS AF and Movie Servo AF to smoothly rack focus during a shot. Shooters can even make use of the 3.2' 1.62m-dot touchscreen LCD to simply tap to adjust the focus point. Furthermore, now that the camera has DCI 4K (4096 x 2160) video recording at up to 30 fps, users can snag 8.8MP stills from the video for an even faster capture option. Tied into the Dual Pixel sensor architecture is a brand new feature for Canon Dual Pixel RAW, which allows for fine tuning of certain image parameters, including bokeh shift and focus micro adjustment, after the image is taken."

Despite its high magnification, the SLC is equipped with a wide apparent angle of view, long eye relief, and wide exit pupil for exceptional performance at long ranges. The large objectives also ensure views remain bright and crisp in low light or when observing at extreme distances. Its phase-corrected Abbe-Koenig roof prisms and extra-low dispersion fluoride HD glass plus the proprietary SWAROTOP, SWAROCLEAN, and SWARODUR lens all work together to deliver the exceptional observational experience that Swarovski is known for.Complementing the optical performance, Swarovski designed the SLC to withstand a lifetime of use out of doors in the harshest conditions. To help offset the weight of the large objectives, the elongated Abbe-Koenig prisms allow thinner optical tubes versus conventional prisms and evenly distribute the weight to make the binocular center balanced for more comfortable handling. To reduce overall weight, the chassis is made of a lightweight and durable magnesium alloy that is wrapped in a protective slip-resistant rubber armoring. The optical tubes are nitrogen filled and O-ring sealed to make them waterproof to a depth of 13' and resistant to internal fogging in extreme environmental conditions and temperature changes. For long-duration observation sessions, the SLC can be mounted on a tripod using an optional adapter to eliminate arm fatigue and vibrations or to leave both hands free for other activities.Inside The Box:-Swarovski 10x56 SLC Binocular-Field Bag-Neck Strap-Ocular Rainguard-2 x Objective Lens CapsExtra Items From 6Ave:-6FT Tripod-Padded Backpack-Binocular Tripod Adapter-Flashlight - For Adventures That Carry Into The Dark!-Cleaning Kit"

          "Mixing a contemporary imaging approach with traditional form and function, the Nikon D780 is a versatile DSLR excelling in both photography and video applications. Featuring a 24.5MP full-frame CMOS sensor, high-resolution stills and video recording are possible, and the sensor features a BSI design for heightened clarity and reduced noise levels to suit working in a variety of lighting conditions.",
          "This sensor also enables a wide sensitivity range from ISO 100-51200, which can be expanded to ISO 50-204800, along with a quick 7 fps shooting rate with the viewfinder or 12 fps in live view. This sensor also permits UHD 4K video recording up to 30 fps using either full-frame or cropped areas. Full HD recording up to 120 fps is available, too, along with integrated N-Log Gamma and HLG settings for refined color control.",
          "Complementing the imaging, when working with the viewfinder, a 51-point phase-detection autofocus system is available, which includes 15 cross-type points for greater accuracy in low-light conditions. When working in live view or recording video, a 273-point Hybrid AF system is used that blends on-sensor phase-detection points and a contrast-detection system for quick performance and excellent subject tracking, including support for Eye-Detection AF.",
