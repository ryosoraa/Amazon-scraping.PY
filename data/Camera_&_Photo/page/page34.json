Engraving in both meters and feet and the focus scale provide additional support for manual focusing. The continuous aperture setting (de-click function with ZF.2 mount) and the long focusing range lay optimal conditions for video photography.",

Thanks to the low level of stray light allowed by the lens design, high-contrast images are possible with increasing high dynamic ranges of the sensors (HDR). The minimization of coma, astigmatism and spherical aberrations enables consistently high resolution over the entire image field. The optics are designed to ensure full utilization of the performance provided by high-resolution camera systems.",

The Advanced VX 8\u00e2\u0080\u009d EdgeHD telescope combines the groundbreaking new Advanced VX mount with Celestron\u00e2\u0080\u0099s best optics, the EdgeHD optical system. This setup offers the astroimager maximum versatility \u00e2\u0080\u0093 allowing up to 3 different f-stop configurations. Users can attach a camera to the rear of the telescope and shoot at f/10 or attach our 8\u00e2\u0080\u009d EdgeHD focal reducer to shoot at f/7. Additionally, EdgeHD is Fastar/Hyperstar compatible, giving imagers the option to shoot at ultra-fast f/2. No matter which configuration you choose, EdgeHD technology gives you pinpoint stars all the way to the edge of the CCD sensor. The Advanced VX mount is designed to provide superior performance while taking advantage of Celestron\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most advanced technologies: All-Star Polar Alignment, Celestron PWI telescope control software, SkyAlign, and permanently programmable periodic error correction (PPEC). If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re an experienced imager, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll love taking this portable mount to a dark sky site and enjoying all the conveniences of a larger observatory mount. Or, if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re new to imaging,\u00c2 Advanced VX will help you get started with the hobby and keep up with your needs for years to come. Computerized German equatorial mount The Advanced VX is the smallest of Celestron\u00e2\u0080\u0099s German equatorial mounts. The computerized GoTo capability automatically tracks objects as they move across the night sky. The Advanced VX mount includes ports for a hand control, an autoguider, and 2 AUX ports for optional accessories.\u00c2 The NexStar+ hand control gives you instant access to all the functions your mount has to offer. With automatic slewing and menu descriptions, any level of astronomer can master this mount in just a few observing sessions. The Advanced VX also has an impressive tripod for its class with a 2\u00e2\u0080\u009d diameter steel tripod legs providing an extra-wide stance for improved stability. Payload capacity The payload capacity for the Advanced VX is 30 lb. It offers a sturdy platform for any of the Advanced VX optical tubes, even when paired with optional accessories like , StarSense AutoAlign , a Focus Motor , and a finderscope . Celestron's payload capacity does not include the weight of the counterweights.\u00c2 camera Dual saddle plateAs of early 2019, Advanced VX mounts include a dual saddle plate that accommodates both CG-5 and CGE-style dovetail. Switching between the two saddle plates is as simple as moving the hand knobs into a separate set of holes. You can use an Advanced VX mount with virtually any optical tube within its weight limit. Compatible with Vixen format dovetails 100mm or longer, not compatible with Losmandy D format plates (regardless of plate manufacturer). EdgeHD Optics The revolutionary EdgeHD optical design produces aberration-free images with pinpoint stars all the way to the edge of the field-of-view of today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s largest imaging sensors and wide-field eyepieces. EdgeHD\u00e2\u0080\u0099s unique design virtually eliminates both field curvature and off-axis coma, providing an astrograph-quality system. For more information on EdgeHD Optics, click . here \u00c2 Software Celestron PWI Telescope Control Software Your Ultimate Astronomy Software Suite All current Celestron computerized telescopes include Celestron PWI (CPWI), the most advanced astronomy software suite provided with any consumer-grade telescope. Celestron\u00e2\u0080\u0099s experts co-developed CPWI with the engineers at PlaneWave Instruments. The result is an all-in-one solution offering you many of the same features used on PlaneWave\u00e2\u0080\u0099s observatory-class telescopes. Graphical planetarium interface with PointXP advanced mount modelling allows you to add 100+ points to your alignment model for the most accurate pointing and tracking possible Ideal for remote observatory setups: save and re-load your alignment and park your scope Provides a complete ASCOM telescope interface to allow control of the telescope from third party software applications For more information on CPWI and to see the user interface, click . here Starry Night SoftwareIncluded with your purchase is a free download of Celestron\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Starry Night Special Edition Software.
