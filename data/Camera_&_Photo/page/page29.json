Get in close from any distance and seamlessly adapt XF 150-600mm F5.6-8 R LM OIS WR to any situation with on-lens functionality that's both easy and intuitive. The Fujinon XR 150-600 is ready for your next adventure. The very best lenses connect a photographer and their subject in a truly seamless way. Never before has an XF zoom lens achieved this to such an unparalleled degree - and over such a distance. As a stand-alone optic, XF 150-600mm F5.6-8 R LM OIS WR provides an impressive 229-914mm full-frame equivalent focal range. Throughout the entire scope of focal lengths, this lens remains the same physical length, so it's always perfectly balanced in use. Rapid and near-silent autofocus is ensured by a linear motor, and a range of physical focusing controls are close to the optic's mount, including AF-ON, AF-L, and a focus range selector. Five stops of Optical Image Stabilization enables creativity in all conditions, while its weather-resistant design works to achieve the same goal of limitless opportunity. All this is housed in a lens that weighs just 1600g, measuring less than 315mm. XF 150-600mm is not just a capable lens inside and out, it's an extension of creativity where imagination is the only limitation.What's Included In The Box:Fujifilm 82mm Front Lens CapFujifilm Rear Lens CapFujifilm Lens HoodTripod Collar FootSoft Lens PouchIncluded With Your Fujifilm Bundle Purchase:1 x Fujifilm Fujinon XF 150-600mm f/5.6-8 R LM OIS WR Lens1 x SanDisk 64GB Extreme PRO Memory Card1 x 82mm 4-Piece Close-Up Lens Filter Kit1 x 82mm Graduated Color Lens Filter Kit1 x 82mm 3-Piece Pro Lens Filter Kit1 x USB Memory Card Reader1 x SD Memory Card Wallet1 x Lens Cap Keeper Strap1 x Deluxe Camera Cleaning Kit"

Its new optical design features Super UD and UD lenses that correct chromatic aberration. Four aspheric lens elements help to minimize distortion from the center of the image to the periphery and throughout the zoom range. A Subwavelength Coating (SWC) and Air Sphere Coating (ASC) significantly reduce flare and ghosting, while a 9-blade circular aperture diaphragm creates beautiful, blurred backgrounds. For silent and fast AF, it features a rear focus system and ring USM, and can be manually focused even when in AF mode. It has a minimum focusing distance of 11 in./0.28m (extreme telephoto) for admirable performance and results even when shooting in tight spaces.
