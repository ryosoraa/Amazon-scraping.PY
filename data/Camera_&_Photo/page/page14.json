        "product_descriptions": "Sky-Watcher's GoTo Dobsonian epitomizes Sky-Watcher's dedication to innovative ideas, combining our exclusive collapsible optical tube design with the convenience of a computerized GoTo mount. The SynScan hand controller allows users to point the telescope at specific objects, or tour the night sky with the touch of a button! Most astronomers crave the large aperture of a Dobsonian telescope, yet the lack of computerized GoTo features can be discouraging for some users. Sky-Watcher tackles this by adding motors to a traditional Dobsonian base, giving astronomers the benefits of a computerized GoTo system. Sky-Watcher's signature SynScan hand controller uses two easy alignment methods, \u2018Bright Star Alignment' or \u2018Two-Star Alignment' for quick and easy setup. Once aligned, the SynScan hand controller can point to over 42,000 objects, including a full catalog of Messier, NGC and IC objects, providing you with a lifetime of celestial observing! While Dobsonian telescopes have a reputation for large apertures at a low cost, they often come at the expense of portability. The GoTo Dobsonian fixes this problem using our exclusive collapsible optical tube, featuring a strut system with three 1 steel poles and chrome locking screws. The strut system uses preset indentations which place the optics in the same position time after time, maintaining collimation. Unlike other Dobsonians using truss-tube systems, Sky-Watcher's GoTo Dobsonian optical tube does not need to be disassembled before transporting from one location to another. With the ability to collapse up to 36%, these optical tubes can be easily transported in the backseat of most vehicles. At the heart of every Sky-Watcher telescope are professional-grade optics. The GoTo Dobsonian is no exception, using borosilicate mirrors coated in quartz, titanium and silicon dioxide. This yields an amazing 94% reflectivity, vivid contrast and minimal vignetting to deliver an exceptional viewing experience. Unlike other manufacturers, Sky-Watcher has a policy of providing you with all necessary accessories to get started. 8, 10 and 12 GoTo Dobsonians include a 2 Crayford-style focuser, with a 1.25 adapter and two 1.25 eyepieces (10mm and 25mm). Whether this is your first telescope or not, there's enough accessories for every kind of astronomer."

Strong & Compact The new Easyrig MiniMax has a range of 4.4 to 15.4lbs (2-7kg) and features an all new overload protection system. If the Easyrig MiniMax spring system is overloaded, the Tripping Mechanism will ensure the internal spring system is not damaged due to the heavy load. Redesigning the Mini The new spring system Easyrig developed has resulted in a smoother rope force. The construction of a conical wheel that unrolls the rope allows for the new feature. Easyrig has also reduced the friction through the entire support process in the new MiniMax resulting in a much more fluid feel and operation."
