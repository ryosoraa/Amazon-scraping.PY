The various models are predestined for hunting trips, long stalks, raised hide hunting at dusk, as well as for long-range alpine shots and short-range bow hunting. The Geovid Pro models feature compact and ergonomic shapes as well as outstanding optical performance. The Applied Ballistics software integrated into all models delivers the most precise ballistics solutions, and the powerful Class 1 laser provides extremely accurate measurement results up to 2,950 meters. Intuitive operation and a user-friendly menu help the hunter focus on the essentials.In addition to the rangefinder, all Geovid Pro models also have a built-in compass. In conjunction with the ballistics calculator, all models can determine GPS coordinates for points in the field. The last five distances measured are automatically stored and can be accessed for navigation. Thus, the LPTTM (Leica ProTrack) tracking assistant can display any previously-measured point on a connected cellphone. This facilitates target checks when shooting at long range or in the mountains.The proven rubber-armored magnesium housing is rugged and protects its high-end interior from the elements, making Leica Geovid Pro models utterly reliable companions."

Similarly impressive, the optical design contains three aspherical elements and two extra-low dispersion elements, which greatly reduce distortion and aberrations for a high degree of sharpness, clarity, and accurate rendering. A Nano Crystal Coat has also been applied to control flare and ghosting for greater contrast and color accuracy in harsh lighting and backlit conditions. Additionally, a Silent Wave Motor enables fast, near-silent autofocus performance, along with full-time manual focus override, to benefit both stills and video applications."

An excellent performer for available light, the AF-S NIKKOR 105mm f/1.4E ED also excels when using Nikon Speedlightsindoors or out. Create beautiful portraits with minimal depth of field as well as using Advanced Wireless Lighting with Auto FP High Speed Sync. Its f/1.4 maximum aperture and nine-blade diaphragm produce a superior bokeh effect with large, smooth spheres with gradual alteration. The focal length (105mm on FX cameras, 158mm on DX cameras) creates an ideal working distance that's close enough to interact with the subject. This is the culmination of Nikon's expertise in lens design, optical excellence and industry leading innovation. Its new optical design creates ultra-high definition across the entire frame, especially when used with one of Nikon's full-frame (FX) high-resolution DSLRs. Its a lens that pushes boundaries of imaging possibility, one that can take your photography and videography to a thrilling new level. What will you achieve with it? Chromatic aberration, ghosting and flare is minimized by three Extra-Low Dispersion (ED) elements. Nano Crystal Coat (N) outperforms conventional antireflection coatings over a broad wavelength range for maximum contrast. Like the AF-S NIKKOR 58mm f/1.4G, point light sources are reproduced naturally without sagittal coma flare and minimized astigmatism, even at the frame edges. An electromagnetic diaphragm (E) maintains consistent exposure during high-speed capture, while fluorine coat ensures a lifetime of brilliant performances. The new AF-S NIKKOR 105mm f/1.4E ED joins other NIKKOR f/1.4 lenses in the Gold Ring Series, which include only premium primes with Nano Crystal Coat and pro-grade build quality. These other lenses include the AF-S NIKKOR 24mm f/1.4G, AF-S NIKKOR 35mm f/1.4G, AF-S NIKKOR 58mm f/1.4G, AF-S NIKKOR 85mm f/1.4G."
