        "product_descriptions": "The Nikon Z 9, their first mirrorless flagship camera, is a professional-grade camera that appeals to both photographers and filmmakers. It's characterized by its newly developed sensor, advanced AF performance, and high-resolution 8K video recording. The core of the Z 9 is the newly developed FX-format 45.7MP BSI stacked CMOS sensor. Its stacked design offers fast readout speeds and helps to reduce rolling shutter, and the BSI design contributes to impressive clarity and minimal noise. At 45.7MP, it's also a high-resolution chip that benefits landscape, portraiture, and video recording. The full-frame BSI design offers a native ISO 64-25600 range, that can be expanded to ISO 32-102400.An advanced processing engine, the EXPEED 7, offers speeds approximately 10x faster than a Z 7II. This engine works in conjunction with the stacked sensor design to realize impressively fast AF speeds, burst shooting rates, a high buffer capacity, and fluid video performance. The Z 9 uses just an electronic shutter for all capture modes. The speed of the sensor enables recording at up to 1/32,000 sec and the stacked structure reduces motion distortion for accurate depiction of fast-moving subjects.Manufacturer Included Items:1 x EN-EL18d Lithium-Ion Battery1 x MH-33 Li-Ion Battery Charger1 x BL-7 Battery Chamber Cover1 x EH-7P Charging AC Adapter1 x AN-DC24 Padded Strap1 x UC-E24 USB-C CableThis Nikon Bundle Contains:1 x Nikon Z 9 FX-Format Mirrorless Camera (Body)1 x Nikon NIKKOR Z 24-120mm f/4 S Lens (20105)1 x Sony Pro 32GB XQD G Series Memory Card1 x Corel Photo Editing Essentials Software1 x Large Padded Camera Gadget Case1 x 4-Piece Close-Up Macro Filter Kit1 x 3-Piece Filter Kit (UV, CPL, FLD)1 x Professional UV Lens Filter1 x 12' Flexible Mini-Tripod1 x Padded Hand Grip Strap1 x Lens Cap Keeper Strap1 x Deluxe Lens Cleaning Kit"

Suitable for both videographers and photographers, this is a fully manual lens, with manual opening and manual focus dials. Full frame compatible, the Laowa Probe lens image circle also covers Super 35mm and smaller sensors. The Laowa Probe is the first consumer goal in the world to focus on the 2:1 macro infinity with a bug eye perspective. The wide-angle design provides increased depth of field, useful even at very short distance, producing more detailed background details, more than conventional telephoto macro lenses. Market macro lenses tend to have a long focal length (from 60 to 120 mm) and the subject fills most of the frame, thereby isolating it from its environment. The Laowa 24mm allows an exceptionally close focus to the reproduced subject at a real size of 2cm, offering a large amount of detail and textures. At the same time, you can enjoy a fascinating wide-angle view 'Bugs Eye' (84.1 degree field of view) so that the environment and background details can be included in the shots. You can easily create a very inform Bugs Eye macro perspective"
