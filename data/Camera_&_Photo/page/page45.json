With professional video capabilities inspired by the D810 and an array of inputs and outputs, the D750 is as well-suited for recording daily life and events as it is for filmmaking and videography. Simultaneously record uncompressed and compressed Full HD 1080 footage at 60/50/30/25/24p. Manually control ISO, shutter speed and aperture while recordingeven use Power Aperture control for smooth iris transitions and Auto ISO for smooth exposure transitions. Use Highlight Display with zebra stripes to confirm exposure, apply Flat Picture Control for easier color grading in post and record at low and high angles with the 3.2-inch tilting Vari-angle LCD. Sharing and transferring your favorite D750 photos is fast, easy and fun. Wirelessly connect to the D750 with a compatible smartphone or tablet, browse the camera's memory card, download your favorite shots and then email them, text them or upload them to your favorite website. You can also use your smart device as a remote monitor and control for the D750see what the camera sees and fire the shutter. For faster wireless transfers, transmit images over FTP using the WT-5A Wireless Transmitter + UT-1 Communication Unit. (Advanced shooters can use a web browser on a smartphone or tablet in HTTP mode to operate camera controls and begin Live View shooting.) A first for a Nikon full-frame D-SLR, the D750 features a 3.2-inch 1,229 dot tilting Vari-angle LCD display. It has RGBW alignment and color balance customization, so it can be matched to an external monitor. Use it to shoot from high and low angles, to spot-select white balance during Live View shooting, to access the intuitively redesigned Info. display or to change settings quickly from the separate Photo Shooting and Movie Shooting menus. Match your view and your vision with the 100% coverage optical viewfinder, which has a bright, clear organic EL display system for making adjustments without taking your eye off the action."

This high-performance lens is part of the S-Line, a newly designated grade of NIKKOR Z lenses that adhere to a new benchmark in optical performance, creating new definitions of design principles and quality control. The NIKKOR Z 24-70mm f/2.8 S demonstrates excellent resolving power that maximizes the potential of high-pixel-count digital cameras like the Z 7, which has an effective pixel count of 45.7 megapixels. Color fringing is significantly minimized with the beautiful, large, natural bokeh unique to the f/2.8 aperture, which makes the lens perfect for shooting highly rendered photographs in a variety of scenes, such as portraits and landscapes, from the maximum aperture of f/2.8. Furthermore, the combination of the larger Z mount with its inner diameter of 55 mm, and a short flange focal distance of 16 mm has allowed the lens to achieve superior optical performance, as well as compactness and lightness for excellent portability. It also offers outstanding movie recording performance with focus breathing control and quiet operation. A multi-focusing system has been adopted as the AF drive system. Via the combination of multiple AF actuators, the position of the focus groups is precisely"

It now comes with a 90-degree periscope-like front tip for creating formerly impossible shots and makes setups more flexible. The lens is also able to do 360-degree helix rotation to create one-of-a-kind motions. Furthermore, it has a 1/4-inch thread at the front for attaching accessories such as extra lighting or magic arms. Periprobe is a very functional tool that frees your creativity. It is not barely poking into the water or sliding in and sliding out. There are a lot more usages that you can explore with this lens. Periscope Users can hold up or down the camera with the periprobe to create a periscope perspective. It is useful when you shoot something unreachable like the tree hole at 7' tall or the crab hiding in an underwater cave. It also makes your set-ups easier since you do not need a big tank and waterproof housing for the shots. Stay close to the ground. It is difficult for photographers to film close to the ground as there are always restrictions in set-ups, like the cameras and the lens itself are always obstacles. Some users would dig a hole in the ground for the cameras or need a more complicated pre-shoot set-up. With Periprobe, you could simply stick the lens tip to the ground. Face up & face down With 2x magnification, 85-degree wide AoV, and close working distance, users could create a special close-up face-up and face-down shot that other lenses cannot do. 45-degree tilt-up Tilting up is never a rare perspective you can see in galleries. However, shooting something very small and close to the ground is nearly impossible without a Periprobe as the camera is always a big hindrance."
