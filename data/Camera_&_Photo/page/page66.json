        "product_descriptions": "Unlike most spotting scopes or telescopes, the Orion 80mm ED Semi-Apo Binocular Spotting Scope sports TWO eyepieces. And viewing with two eyes instead of just one makes observing much more comfortable and provides incredible 3D-like depth of field. Once you experience the Orion 80mm ED Semi-Apo Binocular Spotting Scope, you'll never go back to one-eyed gazing through a traditional scope. The 80mm ED Semi-Apo Binocular Spotting Scope features an 80mm (3.1') objective doublet lens of 500mm focal length (f/6.25) that includes one element of Ohara FPL-53 extra-low dispersion ('ED') glass. This premium optical glass minimizes chromatic aberration to render impeccably sharp images. At the other end of the scope is the newest and most advanced stereo binocular viewer available. It incorporates a dielectric-coated, beam-splitting mirror - not a prism - which reduces aberrations and improves contrast compared to standard standalone binoviewers. Its full 360-degree rotation collar allows you to orient the eyepieces to a comfortable angle no matter where the telescope is pointed. This is especially useful for astronomical viewing using an equatorial mount. Twist-tight collars securely hold a pair of included 12.5mm Orion Edge-On 1.25' eyepieces, which provide 40x magnifying power. Their 20mm of eye relief provides comfortable viewing even with eyeglasses on. The eyepieces are interchangeable, so you can swap them out with pairs of 1.25' telescope eyepieces of other focal lengths, to give you more magnification options. A built-in mounting bracket has 1/4'-20 threaded holes for attachment of the scope to a photo tripod. A Vixen-style dovetail bar is also included for attachment to a compatible equatorial mount. The spotting scope, eyepieces, and dovetail bar all fit inside a waterproof polypropylene storage case. For an immersive viewing experience with both eyes wide open, get the unique and revolutionary Orion 80mm ED Semi-Apo Binocular Spotting Scope!"

The sensor's design omits the optical low-pass filter for greater detail recording capability and the sensor supports a native sensitivity range down to ISO 64 for lush.",

UHD 4K 60p video is supported, too, with the option to record externally in 10-bit using N-Log or HLG (HDR) modes). The sensor also incorporates a 493-point phase-detection AF system, which now supports Eye-Detect AF in Wide-Area AF modes and during movie recording, and permits focusing in low-light down to -4.5 EV.",
          "Additionally, 5-axis in-body Vibration Reduction helps to reduce the appearance of camera shake with any mounted lens. Balancing the imaging, the Z7 II retains its overall physical design, however it has been updated with a new dual memory card slot interface to hold one CFexpress Type B card and one SD UHS-II card for more flexible storage.Both a high-res 3.6m-dot OLED EVF and rear 3.2' 2.1m-dot tilting touchscreen LCD lend versatility to image composition and playback, and SnapBridge.",

Create star trail images that span the entire sky with unlimited continuous JPEG shooting. Whether using a fixed tripod, equatorial mount, connected to a telescope or tethered to a laptop, the D810A can take your passion for the cosmos out of this world. The D810A is designed exclusively for astrophotography, a first for Nikon models. Its IR filter is optimized for H-alpha red tones, resulting in four times greater sensitivity to the 656 nm wavelength than a standard DSLR. Celestial objects like emission nebulae can be captured in staggering detail by the 36.3-megapixel full-frame CMOS image sensor, which has no optical low-pass filter for even greater resolution. Capture views of the nighttime sky you may not have thought possible. Capture the faintest celestial objects with brilliant clarity. An electronic front curtain shutter eliminates internal vibrations, key for sharp long exposure images. Virtual Exposure Preview helps you frame and focus when in BULB or Time Mode, and the Long Exposure M Mode enables exposures up to 900 seconds (15 minutes). Nikon's free downloadable Capture NX-D software has an Astro Noise Reduction filter that eliminates pixel artifacts without sacrificing stars. Shoot an unlimited number of high-quality JPEG images when using the CH or CL Release Modes with a shutter speed slower than four seconds to produce beautiful light trails. Take up to 9,999 photos at any shutter speed with the Interval Timer and create smooth, even time-lapse sequences in-camera or in post production with optional third party software. A 12-bit uncompressed RAW size S* file size makes for faster image transfers and file management without sacrificing image quality. The D810A is designed to withstand the hardships of long-duration, high-volume outdoor shooting. Its shutter has been tested to 200,000 cycles, and its rugged magnesium alloy body has stringently tested weather and dust sealing. Add the optional battery pack/grip for greater comfort and extended shots per charge, and tether to a laptop with a high-speed USB 3.0 connection."
