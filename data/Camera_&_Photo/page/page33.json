        "product_descriptions": "William Optics RedCat 61 Overview Introducing the latest member of the RedCat family: the William Optics RedCat 61. Featuring the patented new William Optics Internal Focus Design (WIFD) and an image circle of 46mm, this RedCat 61 is an extremely robust wide field imaging telescope capable of producing fantastic images. Upgraded William Optics Internal Focus Design (WIFD) If you had to pick one flaw about the existing RedCat 51 and RedCat 71  which there aren't many  it would be that the helical style focuser means that third party accessories must be used to adapt an autofocuser. The RedCat 61 corrects that and then some. Featuring the all-new, William Optics Internal Focus Design (WIFD) Premium FPL-53 Optics & Petzval Design Like its cousins, the RedCat 61 also features premium FPL-53 glass, which is among the best available glass for refractor telescopes today. This high-quality glass ensures excellent image quality and a large 46mm image circle. The Petzval optical design features a built-in flattener so you're ready to image right away without buying an extra field flattener. The Petzval design also means you don't need to worry about dreaded back focus. Simply reach focus with your camera, and you can be reassured that you're getting the flattest field possible. This also leaves an extra few millimeters for additional accessories. RedCat 61 Included Accessories Included with the RedCat 61 are tube rings, a longer CAT series handlebar and Vixen saddle for attaching a guide scope or other accessories, a dew shield cover with patented built in Bahtinov Mask, and a longer dovetail bar for easier balancing. All of this fits into a quality soft shell case that can fit in many luggage bags for easy travel."

The wide angle design means much greater depth of field at close distances than possible with conventional telephoto macro lens, so more background details can now be seen. The front barrel of the lens is waterproof and an LED ring light is mounted at the tip of the lens. It can cover both standard 35mm full frame & Super35 image sensors and is super lightweight to carry!The Laowa 24mm f/14 2x Probe lens is now available for sale. The package includes a white USB cable dimmer (with power adjustment), black USB cable (no power adjustment), lens bag and metal case. Please note that the LED is powered by an external battery (not included in the package).Bugs Eye PerspectiveMacro lenses in the market tend to have a long focal length (from 60mm to 120mm) and the subject fills most of the frame, isolating it from the surrounding environment. Our Laowa 24mm, instead, allows you to focus really close - 2cm (0.8') @ 2:1 to the subject, showing a great amount of detail and texture. But at the same time, you can enjoy a compelling wide angle 'Bug Eye' view (84.1 Degree) so that more of the background details can be included in the shot.

What's more, compatibility with optional TAMRON tele converters provides additional focal length.In keeping with the SP series' innovative technology, the lens is designed to be durable, flexible and resilient enough to rise to any occasion. Every aspect of the SP 70-200mm F/2.8 G2 (Model A025) zoom has been improved, providing high image quality and enhanced bokeh throughout. Optical design features include XLD (eXtra Low Dispersion) and LD (Low Dispersion) glass to eliminate chromatic aberrations across the entire zoom range, ensuring optimum resolution even at the edges. eBAND Coating designed exclusively for this new zoom offers superior anti- reflection properties, greatly minimizing flare and ghosting. And refined bokeh provides spectacular background effects from nearly any angle. Improvements to the new SP 70-200mm F/2.8 G2 extend well into the lens barrel. TAMRON has reduced the MOD from 1.3m (50.7 in) in our older model to 0.95m (37.4 in), allowing a maximum magnification ratio of 1:6.1. The shorter MOD, coupled with the superb optical performance of this new zoom, allows you to significantly broaden your range of expression. The USD (Ultrasonic Silent Drive) ring-type motor, along with two high-performance microcomputers, ensures excellent focusing speed and accuracy. The Full-time Manual Focus override allows you to make fine adjustments while using AF, without having to switch from AF to MF mode. TAMRON's best-in-class VC* image stabilization performance is equivalent to 5 stops**, according to CIPA standards. Plus, this lens offers a choice of three VC modes, including one exclusively for panning. Now you can match the VC mode to your shooting conditions and enjoy sharp, jitter-free handheld shootingeven in low light. * Among 70-200mm F/2.8 interchangeable lenses for full-frame DSLR cameras.(As of January, 2017.

Its rugged magnesium alloy body will withstand harsh conditions, and its 3.2-inch 921K-dot LCD display provides beautiful high-definition views of your shots. For over 80 years, NIKKOR lenses have been regarded as some of the finest optics available. In fact, photographers are still using NIKKOR lenses 30 or more years old! The Nikon Df wouldn't be a true classic camera if it couldn't work with those lenses, so we developed a mount system that works with all current AF-S, AF-D and AF NIKKOR lenses. Additionally, a metering coupling lever makes it possible to use both AI (Aperture Index) or non-AI lenses. Use i-TTL compatible Speedlights, the AR-3 threaded cable release, Nikon's new WR Remote System and even Nikon's exciting WU-1a Wireless Mobile Adapter for instant Wi-Fi photo sharing to your smartphone or tablet!  Attach the optional WU-1a Wireless Mobile Adapter and instantly share your beautiful photos. Connect to the Nikon Df with a compatible smartphone or tablet, then use it to browse your camera's memory card, import your favorite photos and even see what your camera sees and fire the shutter! "

This powered zoom lens is ideal for shooting videos thanks to its host of features that ensure super-quiet focusing and steady zooming. It starts with a constant f/4 circular aperture that maintains exposure throughout the entire zoom range, so you don't have to adjust lighting levels on the fly. When it's fully open, it has a circular aperture, creating rounded defocused points of light for smooth bokeh.This Sony 28-135mm f/4 camera lens alsohas an ultra-quiet wave motor so that the noise of zooming doesn't appear on thevideo soundtrack. Quiet floating motors are also used for the aperture and autofocus, and because they are contactless, there are no gears or couplings that create sounds.When you use this movie lens, take advantage of the SteadyShot image stabilization, which uses gyro sensors to precisely compensate for hand shake and vibrations. This produces a clearer image, one that remains sharp. In addition, the internal focusing mechanism ensures the end of the camera doesn't rotate, which is ideal when you're using a polarizing filter. Extra-low dispersion glass, Nano AR coatings and aspherical lens elements ensurethis Sony 28-135mm f/4 camera lens reduces ghosting, flare and chromatic effects. The Sony 28-135mm F4 Full-frame E-mount Power Zoom Lens has been created to satisfy professional optical and operational requirements for high-quality movie"
