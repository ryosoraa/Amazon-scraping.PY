The 5.7K sensor is used to super-sample internal recordings, resulting in higher resolving images with less noise and artifacting when compared to non-super-sampled recordings. Panasonic acclaimed dual native ISO technology is also incorporated into this sensor. Dual native ISO uses alternative circuitry within the sensor, rather than adding gain or shifting the Gamma of the original signal output, to increase sensitivity while maintaining a high signal-to-noise ratio. The standard native ISO is 800, which works for most production situations. This can be switched to 2500 when working in dim scenarios."

Nested coaxial coarse and fine focus has tension-adjustable coarse focusing and an adjustable lock ring stopper that limits stage range to protect slides and objectives from damage. All-metal mechanical parts, solid-metal frame construction, and a stain-resistant enamel finish provide durability. Microscopes are instruments used to enhance the resolution of an object or image. Types include compound, stereo, or digital. Compound microscopes use a compound optical system with an objective lens and an eyepiece. Stereo microscopes show object depth in a three-dimensional image. Digital microscopes are used to display an image on a monitor, rather than looking through a lens. Microscopes can have monocular (one), binocular (two), or trinocular (three) eyepieces, with varying magnification abilities. Magnification ability refers to the size of an image. Resolution, also known as resolvant power, refers to the clarity of the image. The interaction between field of view (FOV), numerical aperture (NA), and working distance (WD) determines resolution. Microscopes can control magnification through a fixed focus, or through a range of adjustments. They can also utilize LED, fluorescent, and mirror light sources to help control viewing capabilities. Microscopes are widely used in education, lab research, biology, metallurgy, engineering, chemistry, manufacturing, and in the medical, forensic science, and veterinary industries. United Scope manufactures microscopy equipment and accessories under the brand name AmScope. The company, founded in 1996, is headquartered in Irvine, CA."

        "product_descriptions": "The AmScope SM-6TPZ-64S-5M digital professional trinocular stereo zoom microscope has a pair of 10x super-widefield high-eyepoint eyepieces, a 0.7x-4.5x zoom objective, two Barlow lenses, and a clamping articulating arm stand. The microscope has an overall magnification range of 3.5x-90x. The 5MP camera has a CMOS color sensor, a reduction lens, image capture and editing software, and USB 2.0 output to capture or display still or video images on a computer or projector. The trinocular viewing head has simultaneous viewing through the eyepieces and trinocular port, an interpupillary range of 55 to 75mm, a 45-degree inclination to reduce eye and neck strain, and 360-degree rotation to enable sharing. The vertical trinocular port can be used as a C-Mount or 23mm photo port. The WH10x20mm super-widefield high-eyepoint eyepieces combine with the 0.7x-4.5x zoom objective to provide continuous zoom magnification and a longer working distance for inspecting large-scale specimens that require handling or repair. The microscope comes with 0.5x and 2.0x Barlow lenses that can be added to the objective to increase the magnification range. A Barlow lens with a magnification of less than 1.0 reduces magnification and increases the working distance, while a Barlow lens with a magnification greater than 1.0 increases the magnification and reduces the working distance. High-eyepoint eyepieces ease viewing for users who wear glasses, and dioptric adjustment accommodates individual eye-strength differences. A digital stereo microscope, sometimes called an inspection or dissection microscope, has low magnification and a long working distance that enables users to manipulate the object being inspected, and is used where image capture, detailed records, or documentation is required.   The 5MP digital camera has a CMOS color sensor for displaying still microscopy images and streaming live videos to a computer or projector. The camera has 40x magnification and a 0.5x reduction lens that ensures that the display has a similar field of view as the microscope eyepiece. The camera can be mounted in a C-Mount or any 23mm eye tube. The camera includes image capture and editing software that provides still image and live video capture and editing capability, including measurement functions. The software supports JPG, TIF, GIF, PSD, WMF, and BMP file formats and is compatible withWindows 10/XP/Vista/7/8/10 and Mac OS X.. Camera drivers are compatible with Windows 10/XP/Vista/7/8/10 and Mac OS X. The software includes Windows APIs for native C/C++, C#, DirectShow, Twain, and LabVIEW that enable custom application development. The camera has a USB 2.0 data port (cable included). The removable 64-bulb LED ring light provides bright, cool light for working with temperature-sensitive or live specimens. The ring light provides shadow-free illumination, and a rheostat controls the amount of light emanating from the lamp. Power and adjustment controls are located on the light head. The light uses a 110V-240V variable power supply. The stand has an articulating arm with a 40' reach for covering a large work space, and a clamp for attaching the microscope to a work surface. The stand can be attached to ledges up to 2-1/8' (53mm) thick. Microscopes are instruments used to enhance the resolution of an object or image. Types include compound, stereo, or digital. Compound microscopes use a compound optical system with an objective lens and an eyepiece. Stereo microscopes show object depth in a three-dimensional image. Digital microscopes are used to display an image on a monitor, rather than looking through a lens. Microscopes can have monocular (one), binocular (two), or trinocular (three) eyepieces, with varying magnification abilities. Magnification ability refers to the size of an image. Resolution, also known as resolvant power, refers to the clarity of the image. The interaction between field of view (FOV), numerical aperture (NA), and working distance (WD) determines resolution. Microscopes can control magnification through a fixed focus, or through a range of adjustments. They can also utilize LED, fluorescent, and mirror light sources to help control viewing capabilities. Microscopes are widely used in education, lab research, biology, metallurgy, engineering, chemistry, manufacturing, and in the medical, forensic science, and veterinary industries. United Scope manufactures microscopy equipment and accessories under the brand name AmScope. The company, founded in 1996, is headquartered in Irvine, CA."

The GF lens range, which can cope with resolutions up to 100MP, combines the latest technologies with extensive knowledge accumulated from making XF lenses to deliver the best possible image quality and realize the full potential of the new GFX 50S medium format mirrorless camera. This medium telephoto macro lens has a maximum magnification of 0.5x, corresponding to 95mm in 35mm format equivalent. The optical system features a construction of 9 groups and 14 elements, including 3 ED lens elements. By adopting a floating focus method using a linear motor, silent and high-speed autofocusing is achieved while aberrations from long distances to short distances are corrected in a satisfactory manner, dramatically increasing the resolution. Furthermore, by arranging the ED lenses in a well-balanced manner, chromatic aberrations are also properly corrected, contributing to a high quality image. Also, both front and back bokeh give off a beautiful bokeh effect. This lens is equipped with an image stabilization mechanism correcting up to a maximum of 5.0-stop, greatly contributing to handheld shooting in low-light situations. Also, a fluorine coating has been applied to the front most lens, acting as an excellent water repellent and stain-proofer. The intuitive controls include a C position on the aperture ring,"

Characterized by an advanced optical design, this lens uses one super extra-low dispersion element and four extra-low dispersion elements to noticeably reduce chromatic aberrations and color fringing throughout the zoom range for improved clarity. Both Nano Crystal and Super Integrated Coatings have also been applied to control flare and ghosting in order to increase contrast and color accuracy in bright and backlit conditions. A Silent Wave Motor AF system produces fast, near-silent focusing performance that suits both stills shooting and movie recording, which can instantly be manually overridden by simply turning the manual focus ring. Further contributing to photographing in fast-paced situations and difficult lighting, Vibration Reduction image stabilization compensates for the effects of camera shake by up to four shutter speed stops.Manufacturer Included Items:1 x Nikon 77mm Snap-On Lens Cap1 x Nikon CL-M2 Soft Lens Case1 x Nikon HB-65 Bayonet Hood1 x Nikon LF-4 Rear Lens Cap1 x Nikon Tripod CollarTHIS NIKON DSLR CAMERA LENS BUNDLE CONTAINS:1 x Nikon AF-S NIKKOR 80-400mm f/4.5-5.6G ED VR Lens1 x Deluxe Padded Zippered Camera Lens Case1 x 77mm 4-Piece Close-Up Macro Filter Kit1 x 77mm 3-Piece Filter Kit (UV, CPL, FL)1 x 77mm Professional UV Lens Filter1 x 77mm Hard Tulip Lens Hood1 x Lens Cap Keeper Holder1 x Deluxe Cleaning Kit"

There is no viewfinder blackout. Continuous shooting speeds exceed those possible with mechanical shutters. Higher shutter speeds are available, and all without noise or vibration. The ability to keep an eye on moving subjects at all times leads to faultless AF and AE tracking, and the photographer's view is consistently up-to-date with an absolute minimum of lag. In short, the digital promise has been realized at last.
