The high performance optical construction of 21 elements in 14 groups includes five ED lenses and one Super ED lens to help reduce chromatic aberration that often occurs in telephoto lenses. The lens has been designed for handheld shooting with a 5.0-stop image stabilization system and weighs less than 1.4kg. The lens is also both water and dust resistant and can operate in temperatures as low as -10 DegreeC, so it is suitable for use in a wide range of outdoor shooting conditions. A fluorine coating has also been applied to the front lens element to repel water and dirt, further improving the toughness of the lens. CIPA guidelines, at telephoto end. Specifications"

The wide angle design means much more depth of field at close distance than conventional telephoto macro lens so that more background details can now be seen. The front barrel of the lens is designed to be waterproof and a LED ring light is mounted at the tip of the lens. It can cover both standard 35mm full frame & Super35 image sensor and it is super light to carry.Bug Eye PerspecitveMacro lenses in the market tend to have a long focal length (from 60mm to 120mm) and the subject fills most of the frame, isolating it from the surrounding environment. Our Laowa 24mm, instead, allows you to focus really close (2cm @ 2:1) to the subject, showing a great amount of detail and texture. But at the same time, you can enjoy a compelling wide angle 'Bug Eye' view (84.1) ' so that more background details can then be included in the shots. You can easily create a very informative and stunning macro bug-eye perspective that no other lenses can do. The fact that it can focus really close to the subject enables a lot of shooting possibility.2:1 Macro to Infinity FocusAs macro photographers ourselves, we usually face the problem of not being able to shoot smaller subjects. With our Laowa probe, you can now take advantage of the 2:1 maximum magnification to shoot really small bugs and reveal detail s that cannot be seen by naked eye. It is particularly useful for videography as both finer details and environmental background can be captured in one shot.Deep Depth Of FieldThe wide angle design also means much more depth of field at close distance (compared to the telephoto macro lens) so that more background details can now be seen. Being able to focus so close but still having a deep depth of field is a BIG advantage for both studio and wildlife shooting.Long & Tubular Lens barrelDo not understand this weird design?"

Pair it with the new GF35-70mmF4.5-5.6 WR lens and you'll find a wonderfully affordable combination that delivers images from a 51.4-megapixel sensor, which makes it the perfect gateway to large format photography. Get outstanding results with professional features that include 19 Film Simulations, advanced autofocusing, and a vast range of exposure controls providing limitless opportunities for creativity.",
          "The Freedom to Create: GFX50S II features a redesigned in-body image stabilization (IBIS) system that is 20% smaller, and 10% lighter, than the version found in GFX100. Despite this reduction in size and weight, it provides up to an impressive 6.5 stops of five-axis stabilization (based on CIPA standards), providing dramatically broad possibilities for image makers wanting to work more freely with slow shutter speeds. Even when light levels are low, and a tripod isn't available, steady images are on the horizon.",
          "Reassuringly Familiar: GFX50S II weighs just 900g (1.98lb) and is similar in size to many to full-frame cameras, which makes the ergonomically contoured handgrip and PASM dial - used to access the camera's main exposure functions - feel wonderfully familiar and accessible. A gorgeous blend of curves and edges, the camera body is finished with a top-plate LCD to display key settings, a redesigned focus lever, and a feather-touch shutter release to turn that familiar feeling into an intuitive image-making experience.",
          "Responsive Autofocus for Ultimate Creativity.: Fast, reliable autofocus comes to GFX50S II, thanks to a combination of advanced technologies and Fujifilm's powerful X-Processor 4 imaging engine. Sensor readout speeds have been boosted from 130fps to 250fps compared to GFX50S. An improved autofocusing algorithm, taken from the latest FUJIFILM X Series and GFX System cameras, boosts focusing performance in all modes, including face and eye detection. The AF system also brilliantly works in tandem with in-body image stabilization (IBIS) to provide up to 6.5 stops of handheld stability.",
          "Proven Technologies Deliver Outstanding Results: Fujifilm has been perfecting its color science know-how for more than 85 years  and all the knowledge from this impressive heritage has been poured into GFX50S II. The 51.4MP large format sensor uses a specially designed CMOS Bayer array that delivers images with minimal noise and an incredibly wide dynamic range, while 19 Film Simulation modes allow creatives to produce images with colors that stir emotion and memories. Coupled with the ever-growing family of G Mount lenses that can resolve sensors of 100MP or more, this is a camera  and system  that meets the demands of exacting creators seeking the ultimate image quality."
