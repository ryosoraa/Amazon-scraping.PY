If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re an experienced imager, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll love taking this portable mount to a dark sky site and enjoying all the conveniences of a larger observatory mount.

The soft light's bi-color adjustability ranges from 3200K-5600K and works well with any lighting production. It's brightness is consistent across all color temperatures. The 110-degree wide beam angle can easily light a large area by itself. The 30-degree yoke, baby 5/8' and junior 1 1/8' combo pin also allow you to configure or attach them to any stand. Additionally, the yoke's strong steel tension knobs can securely lock the light in place at any angle. On the back, the large yellow control knob lets you adjust the light's brightness, color temperature and DMX channels with just a few simple clicks. The LED readout provides extremely precise measurements for reference. Battery flexibility is guaranteed with AB and V-mount pro battery plates included. You can also plug in the Lyra soft light practically anywhere thanks to its maximum 82-watts at 0.6 amps. Add to that Ikan's reliable barn doors with intensifiers and you can clearly see why Lyra soft lights are the best value package!"
