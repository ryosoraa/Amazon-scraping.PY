Now, eleven instead of nine aperture blades are used for a visibly improved bokeh. In addition, the closest focusing distance was reduced from 70 to 40 centimeters. When shooting up to 70 centimeters, this works as usual via the rangefinder on all Leica M cameras. After a slight perceptible resistance, the extended close-focus range between 70 and 40 centimeters can be controlled via Live View on the screen, the Visoflex viewfinder or the Leica FOTOS app. Lastly, the lens hood is now round, directly integrated in the lens and can be easily available at any time. These new lenses will replace the current Leica Summilux-M 35 f/1.4 ASPH lenses while supplies last (11663). The optical formula and filter size (E46) remains unchanged with this new version. Close focus distance up to 0.4m Made possible by a patent-pending double cam unit newly developed by Leica engineers. As a result, the rotation angle of the focus ring has almost doubled to 176 degrees in comparison to the previous model -with the same compact size of the lens."

It works beautifully with both 1.4x II and 2x II extenders, and now focuses as close as 17.5 feet/5.4 m. It has the same weather-resistant gaskets and sealed focusing and focus pre-set rings as Canon\u00eds other Image Stabilized super-telephoto lenses. See a Different Dimension A super telephoto lens can make an ordinary scene into an extraordinary one. Its ability to see surpasses that of the human eye. It can compress images and make them look as if they come from another dimension. It opens up new realms of photographic expression. All EF super telephoto lenses are L-series lenses to provide the highest quality. The USM provides quiet and high-speed autofocusing. These lenses promise outstanding delineation and put your imagination to the test."

        "about_this_item": [
          "The M11 Monochrom leverages the M11's high-res back-illuminated sensor. It modifies the 60MP full-frame CMOS by removing the color filter array (CFA), enabling exclusive capture of monochromatic images with enhanced clarity, depth, and resolution using luminance values. This omission expands the sensitivity range to ISO 125-200000, surpassing color-enabled M11 cameras.",
          "The M11 Monochrom maintains the Triple Resolution Technology introduced in the M11. This innovative pixel binning technique enables photographers to choose between 60MP, 36MP, or 18MP output. Each resolution utilizes the entire sensor area, and lower resolutions benefit from improved dynamic range and reduced noise levels.",
          "The Maestro III processor enhances the M11 Monochrom with swift processing, enabling continuous shooting at up to 4.5 fps and supporting the Triple Resolution Technology. It also contributes to achieving a broader sensitivity range compared to earlier M camera models. The ISO 125-200000 range features a lower base ISO, resulting in improved detail, while the higher top end provides increased flexibility for low-light scenarios.",
          "The M11 Monochrom is a manual photo-only camera that incorporates numerous enhancements, making it the most contemporary M camera. It features an electronic shutter with speeds up to 1/16,000 sec, ideal for faster f/0.95 lenses without requiring ND filters. A mechanical shutter supports speeds up to 1/4000 sec and flash sync at 1/180 sec.",
          "The M11 Monochrom features a revised monochromatic design, devoid of color. The Leica Red Dot is absent, the viewfinder has a dark chrome tint, dial engravings are filled with white and gray paint, and shutter/bayonet lock buttons are black. The top plate discreetly bears the engraving 'MONOCHROM.'"

Since the sensor only sees grayscales and has no color filters on the pixels, color interpolation is not necessary. This means that details can be reproduced with the highest sharpness and stand out from their surroundings with higher contrast. Since the color filters absorb light in a conventional sensor, more light arrives on the monochrome sensor. This higher sensitivity results in lower noise with the same nominal sensitivity.The Best Monochrome Sensor We Ever Made - Higher resolution and better low-light performance for an impressive image qualityA brand new pixel design results in a completely new black and white sensor, that is exclusively developed to unleash the full optical performance of Leica M lenses.First ever BSI CMOS Monochrome sensor in a Leica camera.Native 60 Megapixel sensor to witness even the finest details."

        "product_descriptions": "The Nikon D610 DSLR Camera features a full-frame, FX-format 24.3 megapixel CMOS sensor and EXPEED 3 image processor to produce high-resolution still imagery and full HD 1080p video with notable image detail and low-light sensitivity to an expandable ISO 25600. The sensor and processor work together to enable high image quality with a wide dynamic range and high signal-to-noise ratio. These two technologies also combine to provide a wealth of speed throughout the D610, including a continuous shooting rate of 6 fps and a quiet shooting mode.A Multi-CAM 4800 AF sensor is integrated into the camera's design and produces fast autofocus speeds using a 39-point array to precisely acquire focus in a wide array of lighting conditions. When recording movies or working in live view, a contrast-detection focusing method works to continuously deliver accurate focus with subject-tracking and face-detection capabilities using the full-time servo mode. Full HD 1080p video is supported up to 30 fps in the MPEG-4 AVC/H.264 format and manual control over the ISO, shutter speed, and aperture is possible for optimized control over the look and feel of movies.Manufacturer Included Items:1 x Nikon EN-EL15 Lithium-Ion Battery Pack1 x Nikon MH-25 Quick Battery Charger1 x Nikon AN-DC10 Camera Strap1 x Nikon BF-1B Body Cap Cover1 x Nikon DK-21 Rubber EyecupTHIS NIKON INTERNATIONAL CAMERA BUNDLE CONTAINS:1 x Nikon D610 DSLR FX-Format Digital Camera (Body)1 x Nikon AF-S NIKKOR 28-300mm f/3.5-5.6 VR Lens1 x SanDisk 64GB Ultra SDHC SD Memory Card1 x EN-EL15 Compatible Lithium-Ion Battery1 x Large Digital SLR Camera Gadget Bag1 x 77mm Professional UV Filter1 x 77mm 3-Piece Pro Filter Kit1 x 77mm Tulip Lens Hood1 x Lens Cap Keeper Strap1 x USB SD Card Reader1 x Memory Card Wallet1 x Deluxe Cleaning Kit"
