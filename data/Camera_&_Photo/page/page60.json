Their ultrawide 63 viewing angle and powerful 12x magnification make this optic ideal for medium- to long-range viewing and offer a completely immersive observational experience. The ELs employ a suite of SWAROVISION coatings and technologies including SWAROBRIGHT, SWAROTOP, SWARODUR, SWAROCLEAN, phase-correcting P-coatings, field-flattener lenses, and fluoride glass. These technologies work seamlessly to produce bright and clear high-contrast and high-resolution images with true color fidelity and virtually no distortion across the entire field of view.Complementing the optical performance is a lightweight and durable magnesium-alloy chassis that can withstand extreme conditions. This version of the EL comes with Swarovski's FieldPro package that features their proprietary rotating pin attachment and adjustment system for the strap that improves mobility and comfort over conventional systems. Included with the binoculars are the FieldPro bag, carrying strap, tethered objective lens covers, and a soft rubber tethered ocular rainguard.INSIDE THE BOX:Swarovski 12x50 EL50 Binoculars with FieldPro Package (Green)FieldPro BagSwarovski LSCP Lift Carrying Strap Pro for EL Series Binoculars2 x Objective Lens CoverHinged Ocular RainguardExtra Items From 6Ave:-Swarovski Forehead Rest for EL Range-6FT Tripod-Swarovski BSP Bino Suspender Pro-Padded Backpack-Binocular Tripod Adapter-Flashlight - For Adventures That Carry Into The Dark!-Cleaning Kit"

It's actually lighter than Canon's EF 600mm f/4L IS lens, weighing just under 10 lbs. It uses a refined optical design, with two fluorite lens elements, one UD element, and one Super-UD-glass element, for outstanding correction of color fringing and superb contrast and sharpness. This super-telephoto lens uses magnesium-alloy barrel construction to enhance its light weight, and has weather-resistant gaskets throughout for use in harsh conditions. It's compatible with both the EF 1.4x II and 2x II tele extenders for even more reach: EOS cameras with 45 AF points will continue to provide autofocus at the center AF point when the lens is used with the 1.4x extender. Finally, it's image stabilized, providing up to 4 stops of correction for camera shake. This makes it even more practical in many situations."

The optical layout makes use of one fluorite element and five UD elements to suppress chromatic aberrations and color fringing in order to realize a high degree of clarity throughout the zoom range. An Air Sphere Coating is also featured, and works to reduce flare and ghosting for greater color fidelity and contrast in all conditions.Complementing the speed and optics is an Optical Image Stabilizer, which compensates for 3.5 stops of camera shake to better enable working handheld and in low-light situations. A ring-type USM and internal focusing mechanism also afford quick, quiet, and accurate autofocus performance, as well as full-time manual focus override. Additionally, this lens is weather-sealed for use in trying environmental conditions.Manufacturer Included Items:Canon EF 70-200mm f/2.8L IS III USM Lens 3044C002E-77 II 77mm Lens CapLens Dust Cap E (Rear)ET-87 Lens HoodLZ1326 Lens CaseTripod CollarLimited 1-Year WarrantyItems Included in Starter Bundle:3 Piece Filter Kit Includes: UV, Circular Polarizer and Fluorescent Filter and Hard Case5 Piece Lens Cleaning KitLens Cap KeeperLens Pen CleanerMicrofiber Cleaning Cloth"

Lens Features SSM (Super Sonic wave Motor) A built-in lens motor for faster automatic focusing with high torque at low speed, quick start/stop response, and quiet, smooth operation. ED (Extra-low Dispersion) glass Four precision ED Glass lenses correct chromatic aberrations and deliver visually accurate results even at full telephoto zoom extension. Internal focusing system Internal lens elements move, so the overall length does not change -- creating a zoom lens that focuses more quickly and doesn\u0092t affect the balance of your camera. 2 DMF (Direct Manual Focus) modes Allow you to quickly revert to manual focus by just turning the manual focus ring of the lens. Versatile focus hold Three focus hold buttons in different lens locations, plus electronic slider focus range selector switch."
