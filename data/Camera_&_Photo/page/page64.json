          "STRONG BUILD QUALITY: As well as using a thick material build quality, the Godox strip softbox has been made with a wide strip of Velcro type material that allows the diffusers and egg crate honeycomb to be fitted tightly and securely. This also allows the diffusers to be set back slightly within the Softbox which makes the light much more directional to avoid light spill",
          "IDEAL FOR SOFTBOX PHOTOGRAPHERS: This strip softbox is ideal for product and portrait photography. It can be used for full length portraits and also widely used to light backgrounds where the length helps to avoid fall-off from top to bottom as well as rim lighting and consistent product photography. The Godox 35x160cm strip softbox is considered to be the ideal tool for creating soft light",
          "INNER AND OUTER DIFFUSER + HONEYCOMB GRID: Removable front and inner diffuser allows for versatility in refining how hard/soft your light is. Both diffusers are highly resistant to yellowing with age thanks to the high quality UV coating, and they can be wiped clean if needed. The opening mechanism includes a deflector plate, that restricts the light in the centre of the soft box to avoid \u2018hot spots' and directs it towards the soft box walls creating even and consistent light",
          "INCLUDED S-FIT SPEED RING: Like most Godox Softboxes, the SB-FW softbox is a Godox fit speed ring, meaning that it works directly with other Godox products, such as the AD300 Pro. However this product also comes with the standard Bowens S-Fit Sped ring to adapt the product to the majority of flash heads.",

The optical design incorporates three extra-low dispersion glass elements to reduce chromatic aberrations and distortions for increased sharpness and color accuracy. Also contributing to improved image quality, a Super Integrated Coating has been applied to lens elements to lessen flare and ghosting for improved contrast and clarity.A Silent Wave Motor AF system produces fast, near-silent focusing performance that suits both stills shooting and movie recording, which can instantly be manually overridden by simply turning the manual focus ring. Further contributing to photographing in fast-paced situations and difficult lighting, VR (Vibration Reduction) image stabilization compensates for the effects of camera shake by up to 4.5 shutter speed stops. Additionally, an electromagnetic aperture mechanism is integrated into the lens design to provide greater exposure control stability that is especially beneficial when working with faster continuous shooting rates.Manufacturer Included Items:1 x Nikon 95mm Snap-On Lens Cap1 x Nikon CL-1434 Soft Lens Case1 x Nikon HB-71 Bayonet Hood1 x Nikon LF-4 Rear Lens Cap1 x Nikon Tripod CollarTHIS NIKON DSLR CAMERA LENS BUNDLE CONTAINS:1 x Nikon AF-S NIKKOR 200-500mm f/5.6E ED VR Lens1 x 95mm Professional UV Lens Filter1 x Lens Cap Keeper Holder1 x Deluxe Cleaning Kit"

        "product_descriptions": "Leading the way to the ultimate image quality, the X100s features the new APS-C 16M X-Trans CMOS II Sensor & EXR Processor II. X-Trans CMOS II incorporates an original color filter array with a highly random pattern, eliminating the need for an optical low-pass filter (OLPF). These filters are used in conventional systems to inhibit moir\u00e9 at the expense of resolution. The X-Trans CMOS II array lets the sensor capture unfiltered light from the lens, achieving an unprecedented level of resolution.Also the unique integration of phase detection pixels in the array contributes to the dramatic leap in AF speed. Fujinon 23mm F2 fixed focal length lens, quality without compromise was the goal when the FUJIFILM X100S was being developed. While featuring the generous brightness of a maximum F2 aperture, the large-diameter rear lens group is integrated into the body for an ultra-slim profile. In addition, the optimization of the sensor for this special lens fully exploits the advantage of a fixed focal length lens for superior edge-to-edge image quality. The new Hybrid Viewfinder offers expanded freedom in a range of challenging shooting conditions. When you want to view the subject with maximum clarity or keep shutter time lag to a minimum, the Optical Viewfinder (OVF) impresses with stunning optical quality. For confirmation of focus, exposure, white balance and depth of field while shooting the scene, just move the lever to Electronic Viewfinder (EVF) featuring an integrated 2,360K LCD. Using the power of the phase detection pixels integrated in the X-Trans CMOS II sensor, Digital Split Image helps you manually focus your shot with greater precision. While viewing the split image displayed in the LCD monitor or EVF, you can manually adjust for pinpoint focus, especially helpful when working with an open aperture or macro shooting. Focus Peak Highlight For pinpoint manual focusing highlights high contrast areas of your subject for smoother and more accurate focusing. Since the age of film photography, the history of FUJIFILM has paralleled the path of the professional photographer.
