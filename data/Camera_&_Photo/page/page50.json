          "NOSTALGIC, ICONIC DESIGN: The Z fc's pentaprism design and body size, the black/silver-color elements, the circular eyepiece for the electronic viewfinder (EVF), and the design of the dials were all inspired by Nikon's legendary FM2 SLR film camera. - Quick, Smooth Autofocus: The Z fc supports Eye-Detection AF and Animal-Detection AF with the shooting of stills and video. The wide-area AF (L) AF-area mode is supported, ensuring the capture of eyes and faces by limiting the focusing area.",
          "OPERATING DIALS: The top of Z fc's body features three dials and a small window that displays the aperture. The dials control shutter speed, exposure compensation and ISO sensitivity, allowing quick, efficient setting changes. Using the aperture display window, users are able to easily confirm and adjust the four basic settings for image-making at a glance. The i button and i menu support efficient shooting, by allowing quick adjustment of a variety of settings with the press of a button.",
          "DEPENDABLE ISO RANGE: The capture of clear stills and videos in dark situations is made possible by covering a wide standard sensitivity range of ISO 100-51200. Additionally, shooting from high angles, as well as vertical shooting from low angles, is enabled with the adoption of the first vari-angle monitor among Z series cameras. When the monitor is rotated to the front, the camera automatically switches to self-portrait mode, providing smooth selfie shooting through touch operation."

The prompter includes a 19\u2033 LCD monitor offering HDMI, DVI, VGA, and Composite inputs and an HDMI output and downloadable prompting software. The prompter works with any standard size tripod supporting the required payload capacity. The downloadable PC/Mac compatible Magicue Pro software is suited for small studio setups and on-the-fly revisions. The modular design of the teleprompter allows for riser-less positioning, allowing the camera to remain stationery while letting the pad and hood unit be lowered into an optimal viewing position.
