        "product_descriptions": " Provides a flat, astrographic-quality focal plane to the edge of the field of view. EdgeHD optics produce a focal plane more than three times flatter than a standard Schmidt-Cassegrain telescope and dramatically flatter than competing coma-free designs. This guarantees you visibly sharp stars on the largest image sensors available today. Advanced VX Mount and Tripod: The Advanced VX Mount is designed to provide superior performance for smaller telescopes while taking advantage of Celestron's most advanced technologies: All-Star Polar Alignment, Telescope Control Software Celestron PWI, SkyAlign and permanently programmable periodic error correction (PPEC). If you're an experienced imager, you'll love taking this portable mount to a dark sky location and enjoy all the conveniences of a larger observatory mount. Or, if you're new to imaging, Advanced VX will help you get started with the hobby and keep up with your needs for years. Computerized German Equatorial Stand: The Advanced VX is the smallest of Celestron's German Equatorial Stands. The computerized GoTo capability automatically tracks objects as they move through the night sky. The Advanced VX mount includes ports for manual control, autoguider and 2 AUX ports for optional accessories. The NexStar+ hand control gives you instant access to all the features your stand has to offer. With auto-spin and menu descriptions, astronomers of all skill levels can master this stand in just a few observing sessions. The Advanced VX also has an impressive tripod for its class with 2-inch diameter steel tripod legs, providing an extra wide stance for better stability. Payload Capacity: The payload capacity for the Advanced VX is 30 pounds. It offers a rugged platform for the 9.25-inch EdgeHD optical tube, even when combined with optional accessories such as StarSense AutoAlign, Focus Motor, a finder and a camera. Celestron payload capacity does not include the weight of counterweights. Dual Saddle Plate - As of early 2019, Advanced VX mounts now include a new dual saddle plate that fits both CG-5 and CGE style dovetails. Switching between the two saddle plates is as simple as moving the hand knobs into a separate set of holes. This means you can use your Advanced VX mount with not only the 9.25-inch HD Edge, but virtually any optical tube within the Advanced VX weight limit. The mount is compatible with Vixen format dovetails of 100mm or larger, but is not compatible with Losmandy D format plates (regardless of plate manufacturer). Celestron PWI Telescope Control Software - Your Best Astronomy Software - All Celestron computerized telescopes include Celestron PWI (CPWI), the most advanced astronomy software provided with any consumer-grade telescope. Celestron experts co-developed CPWI with PlaneWave Instruments engineers. The result is an all-in-one solution that gives you many of the same features used in PlaneWave's observatory-class telescopes. The planetarium's graphical interface with PointXP advanced mounting modeling allows you to add over 100 points to your alignment model for the most precise pointing and tracking possible. Ideal for remote observatory setups: save and reload your alignment and park your scope. Provides a complete ASCOM telescope interface to allow control of the telescope from third-party software applications Starry Night Software - Also included with your purchase is a free download of Celestron's Starry Night special edition software. This advanced Simulation Curriculum software offers detailed information about celestial objects and helps you plan your next observing or imaging session. The Special Edition software also includes telescope control through your PC. The Advanced VX 9.25' EdgeHD comes complete with a 25mm eyepiece, a 1.25-inch star diagonal, and a 6 x 30 finderscope. To increase your field of view without sacrificing performance, add the optional EdgeHD step-down lens , reducing your focal ratio to f/7. And, of course, all EdgeHD optical tubes are Fastar compatible for ultra-high resolution imaging. f/2 widefield lenses. This product only Can be shipped to addresses in the United States and Canada."

        "product_descriptions": "The Aputure Nova P300c 300W RGBWW LED Soft Light Panel is an incredibly powerful tool for any filmmaker. It utilizes warm white and cool white LEDs, in addition to the typical RGB chipset used in color-mixing lights. This chipset increases its output, skin tone accuracy, and tonal variety compared to other RGB or RGBW LED fixtures, making it suited for any filmmaking environment. Combining the stellar color quality with an intense output of over 9,000 lux at 1 meter, a CCT range of 2,000K-10,000K, and a peak tungsten SSI of 85, the Nova is Aputure's most versatile light to date. Stunningly Bright The Nova P300c is capable of outputting over 9,000 lux, at a distance of 1 meter, while maintaining a wide 120-degree beam angle. By combining this intense output with the wide beam angle of a soft light source and 0-100% stepless dimming control, the P300c can easily fill large areas, allowing you to control the ambient lighting of your entire scene instantly. Incredibly Wide CCT Range The Nova P300c features the most extensive expanded bi-color range of any Aputure light, capable of producing white light from 2,000K to 10,000K. The P300c also features the ability to adjust the white light's green-magenta shift while in CCT mode, allowing you to match ambient lighting or manipulate the scene to your choosing. Hardshell Rolling Case Users who take the P300c outside the studio and on location can use the included hardshell rolling case. The case features custom laser-cut foam, ensuring that your P300c Light is always protected. Featuring wheels and a telescoping handle, this case will easily transport the Nova P300c to any film set."

        "product_descriptions": "Continuing on in their legacy of powerful workhorse cameras, Canon has released the 5D Mark IV DSLR which is an outstanding still photography option and an able 4K-capable video machine. This multimedia maven offers a newly developed 30.4MP full-frame CMOS sensor paired with the DIGIC 6+ image processor in order to balance fine detail and resolution with low-light performance and sensitivity. It is able to work within a native range of ISO 100-32000, which can then be expanded to an impressive ISO 50-102400, for sharp, low-noise images in a variety of conditions. Along with these improvements to image quality, users will enjoy a performance boost across the board with an enhanced AF system, built-in Wi-Fi, NFC, and GPS, and much more.In order to deliver detailed images quickly and effectively the 5D Mark IV leverages the power of the DIGIC 6+ image processor, which can handle up to 7 frames per second during continuous shooting. It also uses a 150,000-pixel RGB+IR metering sensor to evaluate the scene and subjects for accurate exposures under a variety of different lighting conditions. An improved 61-point High Density Reticular AF furthers the camera's speed by tracking and locking onto subjects quickly and accurately for tack sharp photos. A new AF area select button is now available as well for near immediate access to this setting.Video benefits from the addition of Dual Pixel CMOS AF and Movie Servo AF to smoothly rack focus during a shot. Shooters can even make use of the 3.2' 1.62m-dot touchscreen LCD to simply tap to adjust the focus point. Furthermore, now that the camera has DCI 4K (4096 x 2160) video recording at up to 30 fps, users can snag 8.8MP stills from the video for an even faster capture option. Tied into the Dual Pixel sensor architecture is a brand new feature for Canon: Dual Pixel RAW, which allows for fine tuning of certain image parameters, including bokeh shift and focus micro adjustment, after the image is taken."
