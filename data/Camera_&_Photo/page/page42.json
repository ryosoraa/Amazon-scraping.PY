Designed to meet the demands of the modern microscopy applications that are temperature-sensitive, like dissecting live tissues or observing live creatures, this scope exceeds all expectations. It incorporates all the most excellent features of a high quality laboratory instrument. This microscope comes with SUPER widefield optics and versatile LED illumination system that provides both incident (top) cool lighting and transmitted (bottom) cool illumination. You can choose between incident illumination shining down onto the object or transmitted illumination through the frosted stage plate. The first is used for the observation of three-dimensional objects and the second for the inspection of the objects that allow light to get through them. This microscope offers high resolution and good depth within a broad field of view. It provides crystal clear sharp stereo images, wide zoom magnification range, and large working distance. Its 45 degree inclined 360 degree swiveling trinocular head ensures an easy observation and rubber eyeguards provide further comfort. This microscope is especially useful for the applications that need cool illumination. It can be used in biology, forestry, archaeology, and agriculture. It is appropriate for educational purposes in hospitals and schools. It is perfect for the examination of insects, plants, or virtually any three dimensional temperature-sensitive objects. The 18MP USB 3.0 digital camera captures still images and video, and allows you to view a live stream on your PC. With software available for Windows, Mac, and Linux, it's a multi-platform imaging solution. The included Windows software offers image-development and measurement tools, as well as advanced compositing features such as image-stitching and extended-depth-of-focus."

Create dazzling full-frame images rivaled only by Nikon's D800 series D-SLR and 1080p Full HD videos. Nikon's superior 39-point AF system and Scene Recognition System means details will be clear and crispfor static or moving subjects. HD video quality rivals more expensive dedicated video cameras. Nikon FX-format quality has never been more attainable. The power of a pro-level Nikon FX-format cameradazzling full-frame images, broadcast-quality 1080p video at your fingertips, superior low-light performance, faster frame rate up to 6 frames-per-second (fps), tack sharp autofocus with 39 focus points, built-in flash with Commander Mode, wireless photo sharing and much moreis attainable in a compact, lightweight full-frame HD-SLR body. A new continuous quiet mode lets you capture a sequence of shots without the noise associated with the raising and lowering of the D-SLR's mirror. Optimized for full-frame shooting, streamlined for compactness and value, the D610 will fuel your photographic passion like never before. Passionate photographers who seek uncompromised full-frame, high-resolution performance rely on Nikon FX-format HD-SLRs. With a level of performance only bested by Nikon's own D800 series D-SLRs, D610's 24.3 megapixel FX-format CMOS sensor, wide dynamic range and high S/N (signal-to-noise) ratio captures every detail with lifelike sharpness and low noise throughout its wide ISO range. Low-light performance is synonymous with Nikonshoot crystal clear images from ISO 100 to 6400, expandable down to 50 and up to 25,600 for extreme situations. EXPEED 3 processing system manages all that data with remarkable speed and accuracy, enabling up to 6 fps continuous shooting at full resolution in both FX and DX formats. Whether shooting people, landscapes or close-upsyou'll marvel at D610's faithful color reproduction. Add Nikon's newest selection of affordable fast f/1.8 primes, compact wide ratio zooms with VR image stabilization or tele- and supertelephoto lenses and you'll see the full potential that the D610 offers. One of the keys to capturing razor-sharp images is a fast, precise autofocus system, and the D610 has one of the best. 39 tightly packed focus points with wide-area AF coverage offer endless compositional possibilities. Nine cross-type sensors in the center offer superior accuracy even when light and contrast are scarce. Seven center focus points work all the way down to f/8 for extended AF functionality with teleconverters and long-reach lenses. Switch between 9, 21 or 39 point AF, allowing for compositional freedom. D610's Scene Recognition System's subject identification and tracking information means enhanced performance by 3D Tracking and Auto Area AF. When shooting photos or HD video in Live View, Nikon's responsive contrast-detect AF activates for accurate fulltime autofocusing. The D610 delivers consistently beautiful images, thanks to Nikon's intelligent Scene Recognition System with 3D Color Matrix Metering II. Its 2,016 pixel RGB sensor evaluates every scene, taking into account brightness, contrast, subject distance and the scene colors, all within the time it takes to press the shutter release button. That data is then referenced against an onboard image database for consistently accurate exposures, auto white balance, i-TTL flash and subject-tracking autofocus performance.  Nikon is committed to developing HD-SLRs that empower and inspire filmmakers and video enthusiasts, and the D610 is proof of that. Shoot 1080p HD videos with selectable frame rates of 30p, 25p or 24p and MPEG-4 AVC/H.264 compression. Bend time with 720p HD at 60p, 50p or 30p for ultra-smooth video playback of fast moving subjects, or create slow-motion footage during post processing. Manually adjust ISO, shutter speed and aperture, activate Live View shooting's fulltime AF with face-priority and subject tracking or manually focus. Experience dedicated inputs for an optional stereo mic and headphones for monitoring sound, still image exporting, uncompressed recording of video via HDMI out to an external recorder, simultaneous live view on external monitors and much more. Multi-area mode Full HD D-Movie gives you compositional freedom using FX or DX movie formats. Enhance your video with the dramatic perspectives and depth-of-field control of Nikon's full line of NIKKOR interchangeable lenses, and you'll dazzle with every video project. With Wi-Fi compatibility, sharing photos is easier than ever. Connect the optional WU-1b Wireless Mobile Adapter and wirelessly transfer photos to your smartphone, tablet or any compatible Wi-Fi enabled device. Use your smartphone to instantly upload your shots to the web or email them to a friend. Install Nikon's free Wireless Mobile Adapter Utility and remotely control the D610and shoot from your smartphone or tablet! The D610's built-in pop-up flash offers up new shooting possibilities that other cameras simply can't matchand not just in low-light situations. Even well lit subjects can benefit from a balanced fill flash for extra depth and dimension. And since the D610's flash integrates with Nikon's i-TTL system, it can act as a Commander and communicate crucial exposure information to two groups of remote flashes across three channels for accurate lighting and exceptional results. When you need the extra power, add an optional accessory Nikon Speedlight for more lighting possibilities. "
