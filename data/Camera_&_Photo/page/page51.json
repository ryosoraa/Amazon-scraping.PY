As one would expect from a cinema zoom, the lens is parfocal meaning it keeps focus across the entire zoom range. The internal focusing with floating elements virtually prevents the breathing of the focus. The lens covers a super 35 image circle, is equipped with a replaceable PL connector as standard and has an EF connection. The 16-fin aperture creates out-of-focus highlights that contribute to the natural-looking bokeh of the lens. The lens is equipped with cine-style gears on the rings for focus, aperture and zoom, making it compatible with cine accessories such as follow focus units, lens motors and lens control systems. The outer front diameter of 95mm allows the use of a variety of compatible third-party mat boxes, and the lens has a 86mm filter thread. With the lens support base, you can support the lens on rods to reduce the strain on your camera's lens port. Note: According to the manufacturer, this lens is not compatible with DSLR cameras that have an EF mount. However, it is compatible with mirrorless cameras that have an EF port, including Blackmagic Design cameras."

This fast wide prime features the same large aspherical element touted in the Sigma 12-24mm F4 Art to control distortion and create stunning imagery. An updated Hyper Sonic Motor (HSM) provides fast and accurate autofocus while 3 Premium FLD and 4 SLD glass elements control chromatic aberration and sagittal comma flare. Building on the highly reputable Art line, the Sigma 14mm 1.8 DG HSM Art is designed to resolve the latest high megapixel DSLR sensors. Like each and every Global Vision Lens, the Sigma 14mm 1.8 DG HSM Art is handcrafted at our single factory in Aizu, Japan and undergoes individual evaluation before leaving Sigma's facility. Complementing the optical performance is an equally adept Hyper Sonic Motor, which provides fast, smooth, and near-silent autofocus performance. This focusing motor also enables full-time manual focus override at any time just by rotating the focus ring for refined manual control and focusing as close as 10.6'. The lens barrel is constructed using a Thermally Stable Composite material, which supports working in a wide variety of temperatures and conditions, and the lens mount is constructed from brass for long-term durability and mounting accuracy. Additionally, this lens is also compatible with the optional Sigma USB Dock for fine-tuned control over focusing parameters and other lens characteristics.With its full-frame 35mm coverage, 14mm focal length for an ultra-wide angle of view, F2 barrier-breaking F1.8, the SIGMA 14mm F1.8 DG HSM Art is the true high-speed ultra-wide-angle lens for which so many photographers have been waiting. Although some zoom lenses are available that can cover 14mm, the large diameter delivering F1.8 brightness is a singular advantage. Going beyond fast shutter speed, this lens can capture a swarm of fireflies with crystal clarity, a beautiful bokeh effect, and outstanding control of light"

This handy, compact zoom lens offers versatility, easy subject selection, and the highest optical performance in its class. The 11x zoom range covering everything from wide-angle to telephoto, and you can focus in on subjects as close as 2.3 feet. A powerful ring-type USM drive provides silent. Featuring a dust- and moisture-proof 'white lens,' it is designed to appeal to professional EOS photographers looking to reduce lens changes and the number of lenses they need to carry. Image Stabilization The lens incorporates Canon's Image Stabilization (IS) technology, compensating for approximately three stops without any perceptible increase in image blur when shooting static subjects or panning. This increases the range of circumstances in which hand-held photography is possible, limiting the need to carry a tripod. Fast Auto-Focus The inner focusing ring-type ultrasonic motor (USM) converts ultrasonic vibrational energy into rotational force to deliver high-speed, high-precision, super efficient and virtually noiseless auto focusing, with good holding torque for rapid response, accurate stopping. Full-time manual override without damage to the autofocus mechanism is featured. Minimum focusing distance is just 0.7m throughout the entire zoom range. Ready for Digital Photography The lens shape and coatings have been optimized to suppress ghosting and flaring, making this lens ideal for use with digital cameras that are more susceptible to reflections off the recording media than are film cameras. Precision Optics This lens features 22 elements in 16 groups for low distortion, high corner-to-corner resolution throughout the entire zoom range. As with all EF lenses, aperture is controlled with an EMD (electromagnetic diaphragm) for fast, quiet, highly precise control and incorporates a circular aperture diaphragm for beautifully pleasing background blur, from full aperture to two stops down. The use of 3 Ultra-low Dispersion (UD) glass elements effectively curtails the residual chromatic aberrations that can plague lesser quality long lenses, while aspherical elements correct various kinds of aberration that occur during zooming to give the lens the unsurpassed clarity and resolving power that are the hallmark of professional L-series lenses. Environmental protection The EF 28-300mm f/3.5-5.6L IS USM features a rugged dust-proof and drip-proof construction, designed for professional photographers working in harsh environments under a wide range of operating temperatures and humidities."

A fast f/2.8 maximum aperture paired with Nikon VR technology delivers exciting new low-light capabilities and beautiful bokeh, while a specialized diaphragm maintains consistent exposure during high-speed shooting. Pro-grade dust- and moisture-sealing and a fluorine coated front meniscus glass element protect the lens' superb NIKKOR optics on tough assignments while Nikon's advanced lens technologies give you every advantage for catching the shots that matter. When it comes to capturing sports or wildlife where the action is fast and the conditions are rarely favorable, lens speed can mean the difference between a great shot and a miss. At f/2.8, the AF-S NIKKOR 400mm f/2.8E FL ED VR gathers maximum light and renders beautiful bokeh. Nikon VR enhances that speed with up to 4 stops* of blur-free handheld shooting, including a new mode specifically for shooting Sports and Action, while a specialized electromagnetic diaphragm mechanism achieves remarkably consistent exposures when shooting at high frame rates. You might not be able to predict the spontaneous, but you certainly can prepare for it. Thanks to lightweight fluorite lens elements and a magnesium alloy die-cast lens barrel, the AF-S NIKKOR 400mm f/2.8E FL ED VR is nearly 2 lbs. lighter than its predecessor, AF-S NIKKOR 400mm f/2.8G ED VR. Anyone who has spent time in the field with a large super-telephoto lens knows every pound counts. And since wildlife and action often mean harsh conditions, it features professional grade dust- and moisture-resistant sealing and a fluorine coated meniscus protective glass element at the lens front. Wherever your assignments or passion take you, the AF-S NIKKOR 400mm f/2.8E FL ED VR is ready. The AF-S NIKKOR 400mm f/2.8E FL ED VR is an advanced lens designed to draw peak potential from high-resolution Nikon D-SLRs. The lens' ultra-fast, ultra-quiet Silent Wave Motor (SWM) provides outstanding autofocus performance with seamless manual override (just spin the lens barrel). Two fluorite lens elements (FL) provide superior optical characteristics while minimizing overall weight, while two Extra-Low Dispersion (ED) glass elements nearly eliminate chromatic aberration, even at f/2.8. *Based on CIPA Standard. This value is achieved when: FX-format compatible lenses are attached to an FX-format digital SLR camera. "

The advanced optical design controls various forms of aberration to achieve edge-to-edge sharpness across the entire zoom range. The use of a newly-developed Nano-GI (Gradient Index) coating technology effectively inhibits ghosting and flare, producing clear images. This is a convenient standard zoom lens that covers a wide range of shooting scenes from the wide-angle 24mm equivalent suitable for landscape photography, to the medium-telephoto 84mm equivalent, ideal for portraiture. The XF16-55mm lens is driven with a linear motor, allowing comfortable shooting with fast, quiet autofocusing. Featuring a weather resistant and dust-resistant finish that can work in temperatures as low as -10 Degree C and can be paired with the 'FUJIFILM X-T1' premium mirrorless camera to take advantage of the fully weather-resistant system . Optically designed to draw out the maximum image quality as a flagship standard zoom lens In order to achieve the best-in-class image quality, the fast standard zoom lens with a constant aperture of F2.8 consists of 17 elements in 12 groups.

In keeping with its tradition of high-performance optics, Swarovski uses highly reflective roof prisms and fully multicoated fluorite-containing HD glass lenses to deliver superior image quality. A field-flattener lens system complements the glass and coatings to keep the edges of the view crisp and sharp. The resulting views are rich with detail and saturated with lifelike color with exceptional contrast and resolution.In addition to its high-transmission optical system, Swarovski also equips the NL Pure binoculars with a range of design elements that improve the handling experience. A re-engineered bridge and focus system provide smooth movement in a short configuration, so you have more of the optical tubes to grip. Covering the magnesium-alloy housing is Swarovski's iconic rubber armoring that provides impact protection and a positive grip where they are needed most.
