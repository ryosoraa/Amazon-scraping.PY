The sensor and processor work together to enable high image quality with a wide dynamic range and high signal-to-noise ratio. These two technologies also combine to provide a wealth of speed throughout the D610, including a continuous shooting rate of 6 fps and a quiet shooting mode.A Multi-CAM 4800 AF sensor is integrated into the camera's design and produces fast autofocus speeds using a 39-point array to precisely acquire focus in a wide array of lighting conditions. When recording movies or working in live view, a contrast-detection focusing method works to continuously deliver accurate focus with subject-tracking and face-detection capabilities using the full-time servo mode. Full HD 1080p video is supported up to 30 fps in the MPEG-4 AVC/H.264 format and manual control over the ISO, shutter speed, and aperture is possible for optimized control over the look and feel of movies.Manufacturer Included Items:1 x Nikon EN-EL15 Lithium-Ion Battery Pack1 x Nikon MH-25 Quick Battery Charger1 x Nikon AN-DC10 Camera Strap1 x Nikon BF-1B Body Cap Cover1 x Nikon DK-21 Rubber EyecupTHIS NIKON INTERNATIONAL CAMERA BUNDLE CONTAINS:1 x Nikon D610 DSLR FX-Format Digital Camera (Body)1 x Nikon AF-S NIKKOR 50mm f/1.8G FX Lens (2199)1 x SanDisk 64GB Ultra SDHC SD Memory Card1 x EN-EL15 Compatible Lithium-Ion Battery1 x Large Digital SLR Camera Gadget Bag1 x 58mm Professional Telephoto Lens1 x 58mm 4-Piece Deluxe Filter Kit1 x 58mm Tulip Lens Hood1 x Lens Cap Keeper Strap1 x USB SD Card Reader1 x Memory Card Wallet1 x Deluxe Cleaning Kit"

Subjects can be tracked and captured with precise detail and clarity within the extensive 24-600mm range. Exmor RS Stacked CMOS Sensor The large 1-inch (1.0-type) back illuminated Exmor RS Stacked CMOS image sensor not only enhances efficiency and speed of A/D conversion through its stacked structure due to more circuit sections. It also realizes super-fast readout speed thanks to a DRAM chip integrated into the sensor structure. Together with the BIONZ X processing engine and front-end LSI, it allows for 20.1-megapixels at up to 24fps continuous shooting. This camera achieves up to 249 frames with AF/AE tracking, blazingly fast shutter speed of up to 1/32000 sec., breathtaking 4K movie recording and super slow-motion HFR (High Frame Rate) movie clip recording of up to 960fps (40x). All that, plus remarkable low-light low-noise capability. Bundle Includes:"

The K-1 is engineered to incorporate all of the performance requirements of high resolution full frame 35mm digital photography, adding PENTAX unique performance features and characteristics. An improved noise processing algorithm provides unprecedented performance in shadows or low light shooting where high ISO settings are critical for good performance. With the highest ISO in it's class, the K-1 has achieved a staggering sensitivity range of up to ISO 204,800. This is attributable to a combination of the new large pixel, full frame sensor that has high noise resistance, and the new PRIME IV processor. Newly developed 5-axis SR II system covers the shake of yaw, pitch, roll, vertical, and horizontal motion of the camera. Shake reduction performance is improved to 5 shutter steps of compensation effect. Since SR is built-in to the K-1 body, it's operation works with every K-mount lens. Combining both the K-1's SR mechanism and the GPS feature, Astro Tracer easily tracks and photographs astronomical objects. By using movement of the image sensor during image exposure, the K-1 sensor generates the same level of moir\u00e9-reduction effect as optical AA (anti-aliasing) filter, without the softening effect. Unlike fixed optical AA filters, this allows the user to adjust the level of the moir\u00e9-reduction effect from OFF, Type1 and Type2. Bracketing of these settings is also available. For quick and easy operation in dark situations, the K-1 has new operation assist lighting placed in strategic locations on the body of the camera. The K-1 is carefully sealed in 87 different places for durable usage under harsh weather conditions. Get the shot anywhere, from any position, using the extremely nimble and flexible Cross-Tilt display. Shoot from the ground up, over the crowd, and around the corner, with extreme agility not found in other full frame offerings."
