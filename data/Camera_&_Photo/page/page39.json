Digiscoping (photography through spotting scopes) accessories are available. Spotting scope bodies are sold separately from the eyepiece, an eyepiece is necessary for viewing. With Swarovski Optik spotting scopes, you'll always have a balcony view. The Swarovski STS 65 HD spotting scope, for instance, offers such features as outstanding long-distance focusing, high light transmission, and a lightweight, easy-to-carry housing, turning every observation into an adventure. The aluminum STS 65 sports a 65mm objective lens diameter and excellent light-gathering qualities, letting you observe objects in razor-sharp detail even at high magnifications and in low-light conditions. Every bit as important are the fluoride-containing The spotting scope comes with Swarovski's 20-60x eyepiece. HD lenses, which minimize color fringing (chromatic aberration) and deliver high-contrast images with precise outlines. The HD lenses are terrific for regular viewing, but they're particularly valuable for digital photographers who want to take pictures through the spotting scope (a process known as digiscoping). And thanks to the scope's straight-angle housing, it's easy to locate and follow birds in flight, or to observe from a car without being seen. Unlike many Swarovski scopes, this model comes with a 20-60x eyepiece that's terrific for dynamic birding situations. That's because the eyepiece lets you scan the terrain with a broad field of view (108 to 60 feet at 1,000 yards), or zoom in close to identify a specific bird. In addition, the eyepiece accommodates eyeglasses wearers thanks to its individually adjustable twist-in eyecups, which are removable for cleaning. And, like all Swarovski optics, the eyepiece produces luminous, diamond-bright images with edge-to-edge sharpness across the entire magnification range. Each spotting scope in the Swarovski Optik collection is well built and protected from scratches or dents. The scopes' enhanced Swarodur or Swarotop coatings guarantee lifelike color reproduction and outstanding image brightness even at dusk. The scopes also feature a nonstick Swaroclean coating on the outer surface of each lens. The coating--which helps extend the lifespan of your lens--is particularly effective when you need to remove dried-on mineral residues (such as water marks from condensation), insect repellents, and tree resin. Finally, each Swarovski scope boasts a rubber armoring that protects against shock and noise. Dustproof, waterproof, and submersible to 13 feet, the STS 65 HD spotting scope carries a lifetime warranty. Spotting scope specifications:"
