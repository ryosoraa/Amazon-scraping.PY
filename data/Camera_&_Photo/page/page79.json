Their wide 66 viewing angle and powerful 10x magnification make this optic ideal for medium- to long-range viewing and offer a completely immersive observational experience. The ELs employ a suite of SWAROVISION coatings and technologies including SWAROBRIGHT, SWAROTOP, SWARODUR, SWAROCLEAN, phase-correcting P-coatings, field-flattener lenses, and fluoride glass. These technologies work seamlessly to produce bright and clear high-contrast and high-resolution images with true color fidelity and virtually no distortion across the entire field of view.Complementing the optical performance is a lightweight and durable magnesium-alloy chassis that can withstand a life in extreme conditions. An ergonomic, wraparound green rubber armor ensures that the binoculars will remain comfortable in the hand during long glassing sessions and helps to maintain a sure grip when it's cold and wet. This version of the EL comes with Swarovski's FieldPro package that features their proprietary rotating pin attachment and adjustment system for the strap that improves mobility and comfort over conventional systems.Inside The Box:-Swarovski 10x50 EL50 Binoculars with FieldPro Package (Green)-FieldPro Bag-Swarovski LSCP Lift Carrying Strap Pro for EL Series Binoculars-2 x Objective Lens Cover-Hinged Ocular RainguardExtra Items From 6Ave:-Swarovski Forehead Rest for EL Range-Swarovski BSP Bino Suspender Pro-Padded Backpack-6FT Tripod-Binocular Tripod Adapter-Flashlight - For Adventures That Continue Into the Dark!-Cleaning Kit"
