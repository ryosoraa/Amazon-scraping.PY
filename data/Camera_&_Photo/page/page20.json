The prisms are phase corrected to enhance sharpness and reduce chromatic aberration. And each of the fluorite-containing HD glass elements is finished with multiple layers of SWAROTOP anti-reflective lens coating. Resulting images transmitted by the SLC optical path are rich with detail and saturated with lifelike color.Complementing the HD optics and improved ergonomics of the SLC series binoculars is a nitrogen-filled housing that is airtight to a depth of 13 ft. Swarovski finishes the exposed lens surfaces with their SWARODUR scratch-resistant and anti-reflective coating, as well as SWAROCLEAN non-stick lens coating, which repels moisture and prevents residue from adhering to the exposed glass.
