        "product_descriptions": " D is depth, the horizontal distance from front to back). Microscopes are instruments used to enhance the resolution of an object or image. Types include compound, stereo, or digital. Compound microscopes use a compound optical system with an objective lens and an eyepiece. Stereo microscopes show object depth in a three-dimensional image. Digital microscopes are used to display an image on a monitor, rather than looking through a lens. Microscopes can have monocular (one), binocular (two), or trinocular (three) eyepieces, with varying magnification abilities. Magnification ability refers to the size of an image. Resolution, also known as resolvant power, refers to the clarity of the image. The interaction between field of view (FOV), numerical aperture (NA), and working distance (WD) determines resolution. Microscopes can control magnification through a fixed focus, or through a range of adjustments. They can also utilize LED, fluorescent, and mirror light sources to help control viewing capabilities. Microscopes are widely used in education, lab research, biology, metallurgy, engineering, chemistry, manufacturing, and in the medical, forensic science, and veterinary industries. United Scope manufactures microscopy equipment and accessories under the brand name AmScope. The company, founded in 1996, is headquartered in Irvine, CA."

This telephoto zoom lens has a large aperture of F2.8 that is constant throughout the zoom range. The angle of view of the 120-300mmF2.8 varies from 20.4degree to 8.2degree and offers great versatility of composition from a fixed position. Two Special Low Dispersion (SLD) glass elements in the front lens group and two in the rear group offer effective compensation of color aberration. Since focusing and zooming do not change its overall length, this lens offers ease of handling. HSM ensures a quiet, high-speed, AF as well as full-time manual focus (for Sigma, Canon and Nikon mounts). The Sigma APO 120-300mm f2.8 EX DG HSM Lens for Nikon Digital SLR Cameras features a large aperture of f2.8 at the 300 millimeter focal length and is optimized for used with digital SLR cameras. This lens transforms a large-aperture f2.8 300 millimeter lens into a zoom lens that allows you to determine the picture composition you want without having to change your vantage point. It has two SLD (Special Low Dispersion) glass elements in front group and another SLD element in the rear group for excellent correction of chromatic aberration. The latest in multi-layer lens coating technology and lens design reduce flare and ghosting, which is a common problem with digital cameras, and it also creates an optimum color balance through the entire zoom range. The lens' AF drive is equipped with a silent, responsive and high speed Hyper Sonic Motor (HSM), which also provides full-time manual focus function. Since focusing and zooming do not change its overall length, this lens is easy to hold and use. In addition, since the front of the lens does not rotate, a circular polarizing filter can be easily attached and used. High-speed focusing is possible when this lens is used with dedicated APO EX 1.4 x or 2x tele-converters (sold separately)."

        "product_descriptions": "Powerful photos are yours with the Sony 24-70mm f/2.8 E-mount lens. It's designed for your mirrorless camera, so it works in harmony with the autofocus and the digital image processing, and the E-mount connection clips in seamlessly. It has 18 elements that let it maintain a consistent f/2.8 aperture right through the zoom to give you rapid results even at 70mm. In addition, the extra-low dispersion glass reduces chromatic aberrations to eliminate distortion and discoloration, and the Nano AR coating eliminates unwanted reflections. Without modifications, this zoom lens can focus on objects as little as 15 inches away at 24mm, letting you get closer to the action, yet it's also ideal for portrait photography as it passes straight through the standard portrait range. While it's designed for full-frame cameras, it also works with APS-C E-mount cameras to produce a 35mm equivalent focal length of 36-105mm. When you're on the go, a zoom lock button prevents the lens from telescoping downward. Fast, quiet autofocus combines with manual focusing rings when needed so that you can control this Sony 24-70mm f/2.8 E-mount lens with ease. Sony FE 24-70mm F2.8 GM Standard Zoom Lens Featuring some of the most advanced lens technologies in the market today, the new FE 24-70mm F2.8 GM (model SEL2470GM) is the ultimate choice for those seeking the highest possible optical performance for portrait, travel and event photography or even simple everyday shooting."
