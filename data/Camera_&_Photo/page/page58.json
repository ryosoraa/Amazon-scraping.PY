          "Improved processing, greater versatility, but familiar in design, the Nikon Z7 II takes everything that was great from the original and ups its capabilities even more. Sporting a high-resolution 45.7MP FX-format BSI CMOS sensor and dual EXPEED 6 image processors, the Z7 II is clearly aimed at the detail-obsessed image-maker. The sensor's design omits the optical low-pass filter for greater detail recording capability and the sensor supports a native sensitivity range down to ISO 64 for lush.",
          "Updated processing also yields faster speeds, including a quickened 10 fps continuous shooting rate and deeper buffer for working with moving subjects. UHD 4K 60p video is supported, too, with the option to record externally in 10-bit using N-Log or HLG (HDR) modes). The sensor also incorporates a 493-point phase-detection AF system, which now supports Eye-Detect AF in Wide-Area AF modes and during movie recording, and permits focusing in low-light down to -4.5 EV.",
          "Additionally, 5-axis in-body Vibration Reduction helps to reduce the appearance of camera shake with any mounted lens. Balancing the imaging, the Z7 II retains its overall physical design, however it has been updated with a new dual memory card slot interface to hold one CFexpress Type B card and one SD UHS-II card for more flexible storage.Both a high-res 3.6m-dot OLED EVF and rear 3.2' 2.1m-dot tilting touchscreen LCD lend versatility to image composition and playback, and SnapBridge.",

        "product_descriptions": "Proving that speed and resolution can indeed coexist, the Nikon D850 Digital Camera is a multimedia DSLR that brings together robust stills capabilities along with apt movie and time-lapse recording. Revolving around a newly designed 45.7MP BSI CMOS sensor and proven EXPEED 5 image processor, the D850 is clearly distinguished by its high resolution for recording detailed imagery. Working in conjunction with the sensor is the EXPEED 5 image processor, which together afford a 7 fps continuous shooting rate for up to 51 consecutive frames, an expandable sensitivity range from ISO 32 to 102400, and 4K UHD video recording using either a DX crop or the entire area of the full-frame sensor. An 8K time-lapse recording mode is also available, as well as additional specialized recording modes. Benefitting the imaging capabilities is an advanced Multi-CAM 20K 153-point AF system, which debuted with the flagship D5 and offers 99 cross-type sensors for refined focusing accuracy in a variety of lighting conditions.Checking off a number of boxes for multimedia image-makers, the D850 positions itself as not only a high-resolution DSLR but also as a camera for speed, movies, and low-light shooting needs. Balancing the versatile imaging features, the D850 is also equally refined in its physical design. A large optical pentaprism offering a wide field of view and 0.75x magnification affords photographers a bright, clear, and realistic view for critical shooting needs. Conversely, a 3.2' 2.36m-dot LCD touchscreen is also available for live view shooting, playback, and menu navigation, and features a tilting design to suit working from high and low angles. A weather-sealed design is also employed, to suit working in a variety of environmental conditions. Additionally, built-in SnapBridge allows for wireless sharing of low-resolution imagery and remote live view use on a linked mobile device."

The lenses provide coverage of an extended zoom range with a relatively fast maximum aperture. Both cover Super35 sensors and have similar lengths, weight, lens gear positions, and front outer diameter, making for fast lens swaps. Each lens comes standard with a PL mount and includes a Canon EF Mount, for compatibility with a wide range of digital cinema cameras. The lenses hold focus throughout the focal length range and feature matching 16-blade irises for producing round out-of-focus highlights. This bundle includes a durable protective case for transport and storage."

While minimizing distortion, this lens offers outstanding F2.8 brightness throughout the zoom range and delivers top-level image quality at every focal length and every shooting distance. For these reasons, it is the definitive wide-aperture ultra-wide-angle zoom lens. Outstanding Art line image quality Designed to team up with 50-megapixel-plus cameras and offer top-level optical performance throughout the zoom range, the 14-24mm F2.8 DG HSM | Art incorporates three FLD glass elements, three SLD glass elements, and three aspherical lens elements, including one large-diameter aspherical element. Effective distribution of these high-refractive-index glass elements further enhances the corrective effect of the FLD and SLD glass. This optical system minimizes transverse chromatic aberration and other optical aberrations, resulting in outstanding high-resolution image quality. The first element in the optical system is a large-diameter aspherical lens. Optimizing the power distribution of this and the other lens elements minimizes distortion to 1% or lower.* As a result, points of light appear as points without streaking from the center of the image to the edge, and the light volume is also abundant throughout the frame. In addition, simulations performed from the design stage onward have helped minimize flare and ghosting. In combination, these technologies ensure excellent ult"

The bridge design provides a large surface area for the hands with a comfortable and balanced feel in the hand. This trim form factor is relatively light and small enough to pack and travel with ease and won't cause strain when worn around the neck for prolonged periods. The optical tubes are nitrogen filled to prevent internal fogging and O-ring sealed to be waterproof and submersible for short periods of time.

Nested coaxial coarse and fine focus has tension-adjustable coarse focusing and an adjustable lock ring stopper that limits stage range to protect slides and objectives from damage. All-metal mechanical parts, solid-metal frame construction, and a stain-resistant enamel finish provide durability. Microscopes are instruments used to enhance the resolution of an object or image. Types include compound, stereo, or digital. Compound microscopes use a compound optical system with an objective lens and an eyepiece. Stereo microscopes show object depth in a three-dimensional image. Digital microscopes are used to display an image on a monitor, rather than looking through a lens. Microscopes can have monocular (one), binocular (two), or trinocular (three) eyepieces, with varying magnification abilities. Magnification ability refers to the size of an image. Resolution, also known as resolvant power, refers to the clarity of the image. The interaction between field of view (FOV), numerical aperture (NA), and working distance (WD) determines resolution. Microscopes can control magnification through a fixed focus, or through a range of adjustments. They can also utilize LED, fluorescent, and mirror light sources to help control viewing capabilities. Microscopes are widely used in education, lab research, biology, metallurgy, engineering, chemistry, manufacturing, and in the medical, forensic science, and veterinary industries. United Scope manufactures microscopy equipment and accessories under the brand name AmScope. The company, founded in 1996, is headquartered in Irvine, CA."
