Capable of holding 40 lbs. of payload and slewing at 5 degrees per second, you will be able to instantly point to any of the celestial objects in the database. The CGEM II contains innovative new features such as the dual-sized dovetail saddle plate, graduated markings on the tripod legs, USB 2.0 connection on hand controller for PC connection, Permanent Periodic Error Correction, dedicated auto guider port and the ability to track past the meridian. SkyAlign Ideal for beginners and advancers users alike, SkyAlign makes aligning a computerized telescope fast, easy, and accurate. Simply point at any three bright objects in the sky and the telescope aligns itself. From there, navigation and tracking is as easy as pushing a button. EdgeHD Optics Celestron's revolutionary aplanatic EdgeHD optics reduce off-axis star coma while providing an astrograph-quality flat focal plane all the way to the edge of the field of view. The result is a focal plane more than three times flatter than a standard Schmidt-Cassegrain telescope and dramatically flatter than other competing coma-free designs, guaranteeing sharp stars across today's largest CCD sensors."

With a redesigned housing and updated optics, this lens breathes new life into the beloved 50mm f/1.4. Widely recognized as one of the most adaptable lenses, the enhanced 50mm f/1.4 now presents an improved minimum focusing distance of 1.5 feet, an innovative 11-blade diaphragm for smoother bokeh, and a refreshed lens body that harmonizes with the sleek and lightweight design of the Summilux-M 35mm. It also features a built-in, retractable lens hood. As part of the distinguished Summilux class, it delivers impressive high-speed performance, making it suitable for low-light conditions and providing superior control over depth of field. The updated optical design is finely tuned to complement the latest high-resolution sensors, resulting in heightened sharpness, resolution, and contrast. An aspherical element minimizes spherical aberrations and distortion, ensuring precise image reproduction. Furthermore, the new 11-blade diaphragm produces a visually pleasing, rounded bokeh when shooting at intermediate apertures. The lens boasts an M-Mount design, aligning with the aesthetic updates seen in other modern Summilux-M lenses, such as the 35mm f/1.4. The minimum focusing distance has been reduced from 2.3 feet to 1.5 feet, making it a perfect match for cameras with live view capabilities or when using the Visoflex or Leica FOTOS app. While rangefinder focusing is limited to 2.3 feet, live view focusing can be employed between 2.3 feet and 1.5 feet. The integrated retractable lens hood eliminates the necessity for an additional hood, streamlining portability and convenience. Compact in design, it measures 2.3 x 2.3 inches and weighs just under 12 ounces. The conventional M bayonet lens mount includes 6-bit encoding, ensuring compatibility with a range of M-mount rangefinder cameras."

The advanced optical design controls various forms of aberration to achieve edge-to-edge sharpness across the entire zoom range. The use of a newly-developed Nano-GI (Gradient Index) coating technology effectively inhibits ghosting and flare, producing clear images. This is a convenient standard zoom lens that covers a wide range of shooting scenes from the wide-angle 24mm equivalent suitable for landscape photography, to the medium-telephoto 84mm equivalent, ideal for portraiture. The XF16-55mm lens is driven with a linear motor, allowing comfortable shooting with fast, quiet autofocusing. Featuring a weather resistant and dust-resistant finish that can work in temperatures as low as -10C and can be paired with the 'FUJIFILM X-T1' premium mirrorless camera to take advantage of the fully weather-resistant system .

In keeping with its tradition of high-performance optics, Swarovski uses highly reflective roof prisms and fully multicoated fluorite-containing HD glass lenses to deliver superior image quality. A field-flattener lens system complements the glass and coatings to keep the edges of the view crisp and sharp. The resulting views are rich with detail and saturated with lifelike color with exceptional contrast and resolution.In addition to its high-transmission optical system, Swarovski also equips the NL Pure binoculars with a range of design elements that improve the handling experience. A re-engineered bridge and focus system provide smooth movement in a short configuration, so you have more of the optical tubes to grip. Covering the magnesium-alloy housing is Swarovski's iconic rubber armoring that provides impact protection and a positive grip where they are needed most. The housing is nitrogen-filled and O-ring sealed to be resistant to internal fogging and waterproof to a depth of 13 feet.Manufacturers Items Include:-Swarovski 10x42 NL Pure Binoculars-Cleaning Kit-Neck Strap-Carrying Case-1-Piece Ocular Rainguard-2 x Objective Lens Cover Filler Piece-2 x Objective Lens Connector-2 x Objective Lens CapsExtra Items From 6Ave:-Swarovski BSP Bino Suspender Pro-Padded Backpack-Flashlight-6Ave Cleaning Kit"
