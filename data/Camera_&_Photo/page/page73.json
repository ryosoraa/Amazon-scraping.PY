        "product_descriptions": "This is the 20x-USB Gen2 model of the PTZOptics line-up of advanced live streaming cameras, in gray, featuring a USB 3.0 output for connecting to a computer for HD web conferencing. The Gen2 model is capable of 1080p60/50 recording (instead of a max of 30 fps), and streaming in H.265 and MJPEG in addition to H.264. This camera has a 4.4 - 88.5mm lens providing a 20x zoom range, allowing for effective close-focus and wide-angle shots to best suit both face-to-face and group meetings. It does well in low-light conditions owing to a fast f/1.8 - f/2.8 lens aperture and minimum illumination requirement of only 0.5 lux at f/1.8. On top of this, built-in wide dynamic range and 2D/3D noise cancellation further enhance the conferencing experience. The USB output is also backward compatible with USB 2.0 as long as the resolution is set to 960 x 540. This camera, along with its entire family of 20x and 12x models, is completely open source so developers can customize everything they prefer using simple HTML commands. The USB models do require a quad-core computer (Mac or Windows) for reliable processing of their uncompressed 1080p video output, but most computers are presently up to this standard anyway. In addition to the USB output, the camera also has LAN, HDMI, and composite outputs, RS-232 input and output with daisy-chain capability, and an RS-485 port. The USB, LAN, and HDMI outputs can be used simultaneously at the same resolution, which can be assigned via a dial on the rear. The composite output can only be used by itself and at 480i/576i resolution. The LAN output is capable of streaming two H.264 or two H.265 RTSP signals, one in HD and one in SD, or a single MJPEG signal, and allows for direct distribution to CDNs, streaming services, and other destinations, using only the camera. There's also a 3.5mm audio input specifically for embedding audio into the LAN stream so you can deliver both audio and video to your destination."

They are the first full frame cine lenses to utilize carbon fiber for a sturdier, lighter, durable and more future oriented design and appearance. Carbon fiber is rarely used for precision machinery due its difficulty in molding. Credit must be given to the R&D designers who developed a technique for molding the material into the shape and size suitable for use in precise lens construction. The cost premium of carbon fiber was another challenge that was overcome to allow the CF cine lenses to remain within the reach of both renowned and aspiring cinematographers. With an average weight of only 2.12lb/.96kg and length of 3.7/93.5mm in PL mount for all five focal lengths, they offer exceptional compatibility and flexible operation with equipment such as drones and gimbals. ROKINON XEEN CF lenses support large image sensors and 8K capability of the latest cinema cameras. The unique X-coating technology, optical design, bright T1.5 aperture (T2.6 for the 16mm), and 11 blade diaphragm can be effectively controlled to create distinctive looks, produce excellent low light performance and beautiful bokeh. Additional features are changeable mounts, a common front diameter of 95mm for easy use with matte boxes, and luminous glow-in-the-dark markings for easy operation in low-light conditions. True cine lens features include unified focus and aperture gear positions for easier follow focus use, tight color matching, dual calibrated right and left side distance and T-stop scales and incredibly smooth movement of the geared focusing and aperture controls. The XEEN CF 135mm T2.2 augments the 16mm T2.6, 24mm T1.5, 35mm T1.5, 50mm T1.5 and 85mm T1.5 CF models to form a core set of five highly versatile and capable cine primes."

        "product_descriptions": "Full-frame shooting produces great results when combined with this Sony 28-135mmf/4 camera lens. This powered zoom lens is ideal for shooting videos thanks to its host of features that ensure super-quiet focusing and steady zooming. It starts with a constant f/4 circular aperture that maintains exposure throughout the entire zoom range, so you don't have to adjust lighting levels on the fly. When it's fully open, it has a circular aperture, creating rounded defocused points of light for smooth bokeh.This Sony 28-135mm f/4 camera lens alsohas an ultra-quiet wave motor so that the noise of zooming doesn't appear on thevideo soundtrack. Quiet floating motors are also used for the aperture and autofocus, and because they are contactless, there are no gears or couplings that create sounds.When you use this movie lens, take advantage of the SteadyShot image stabilization, which uses gyro sensors to precisely compensate for hand shake and vibrations. This produces a clearer image, one that remains sharp. In addition, the internal focusing mechanism ensures the end of the camera doesn't rotate, which is ideal when you're using a polarizing filter. Extra-low dispersion glass, Nano AR coatings and aspherical lens elements ensurethis Sony 28-135mm f/4 camera lens reduces ghosting, flare and chromatic effects. The Sony 28-135mm F4 Full-frame E-mount Power Zoom Lens has been created to satisfy professional optical and operational requirements for high-quality movie"

A sophisticated optical design with two extra refractive elements, three low dispersion elements, three glass-molded aspherical elements, and one hybrid aspherical element helps to suppress aberrations and distortion throughout the zoom range while eBAND and BBAR coatings have been applied to individual elements to control lens flare and ghosting for improved contrast and color fidelity. Balancing its optical attributes, this lens also utilizes a USM autofocus motor to deliver notably quick, quiet, and precise focusing performance that suits both stills and video applications. Also, 5-stop-effective Vibration Compensation helps to minimize the appearance of camera shake for sharper handheld shooting in difficult lighting conditions. Additionally, the lens is moisture-resistant and has a fluorine coating on the front element to enable its use in trying environmental conditions.
