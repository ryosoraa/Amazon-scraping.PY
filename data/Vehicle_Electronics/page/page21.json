Maximized for 14 volt applications, the IX6.1 delivers a tidal wave of power, coming in at 6000 watts at 1 ohm mono. While paying its respects to its cousin, the 40.1, the all new IX6.1 Reserve retains the compact footprint, sleek looks, built in voltmeter, high quality components, and is chock full of features. That is where the similarities end.",

With a trio of 1/0 gauge inputs and grounds, you know that the IX6.1 is going to have no problems delivering on our reputation of no-nonsense mega power amplifiers. Showing just how crazy we are about mega wattage, there is even strapping connections on the IX6.1 for installs that will need more than 6000 watts.",

        "product_descriptions": "The 3rd Generation IA40.1 started out in development as a traditional amplifier, much like previous models. The IA80.1 had just finished development as our biggest show piece with SplitForce Technology, in a last minute twist engineering decided to make the IA40.1 model with SplitForce and keep the price points the same. With all of the parts already tooled and all the engineering done, the IA40.1 came to life in less than 30 days, allowing for another monster to be born with massive power at just over a foot long. The end result is an amplifier that is just 4% bigger in footprint than an IA20.1, while cracking out over 8,000 watts RMS in competition. SplitForce Technology is a patent pending approach developed by Incriminator Audio to create more powerful amplifiers with a smaller footprint. SplitForce divides the power supply section and the audio section into two halves and places them on top of each other in a vertical configuration, and uses link cables to attach the two sides together creating a working unit that can function like existing amplifiers, while both sides have their own PCB. The end result is an amplifier that is 50% smaller in length, while still maintaining the ability to strap or link amplifiers. The additional two inches in height allows space to add many extra features such as an onboard voltage display, remote indicator (REM-I) plug which allows you to monitor the status of your amplifier from another location such as the dash or podium of your vehicle, three extra cooling fans, segmented power and ground connections. This unit has all the features, function, and power you need on the streets or in the lanes."

From plug-&-play kit solutions, true weatherproof ratings, to factory fit and finishes, SSV has set the standard in UTV audio from the very beginning! Plug-&-Play: No Soldering, cutting or crimping! Designed to install as easy as possible. Simply bolt down the speaker enclosures with the pre-installed speakers, run the vehicle specific plug-&-play wiring, turn the key and go! Made to install as easy as possible, you spend less time wrenching and more time riding! Factory Fit and Finish: Each kit looks just the way it should, like it came straight from the factory. Purpose built, our enclosures match the factory styling and fits with seamless precision. Trail Ready: Built for the off-road environment, SSV Works' audio components will withstand all the harsh riding conditions. From sand, dust, water or snow, you can ride your favorite trails without sacrificing premium audio from SSV Works. Premium Quality: Our kits include our patented Phase EQ amplifier and Rock \u2018N Ride switch to power your new audio kit for your UTV. Phase EQ: When other companies say their amps come pretuned, all they are doing is setting the gains and a few other settings. Our Phase EQ amp comes DSP (Digital Signal Processor) tuned to your specific vehicle and audio-kit you're purchasing. This means the frequencies have been tuned to process your favorite audio to sound the absolute best, no matter your riding style. The way Phase EQ processes the audio is the same as you would find in today's luxury on-road vehicles. Because of this, we can better utilize the power output, allowing Phase EQ to our-preform larger more powerful amplifiers. More watts do not always mean better or louder. Rock \u2018N Ride: Our patented new switch comes with every Phase EQ amplifier. It fits in your standard rocker-switch location and allows you to switch between multiple audio profiles. Ready to hit the trail? select RIDE and the amp will process the audio to compensate for wind and engine noise, as well as boost the frequencies would lose from wearing your helmet, achieving the most energized listening experience in the cab, while riding. Back at camp? Hit ROCK to switch to a profile tuned to sound more optimal outside of the vehicle. This provides the fullest sonic and most optimal sound while you're cracking a cold one by the fire."

And when it comes to building amplifiers whose performance exceeds anything else in their class, no other brand has more success stories than Sunfire. The latest and best example of this fact is our new flagship amplifier, the TGA-7401. As its name implies, this is a true 7-channel amplifier that offers a relentless 7x400 watt profile, earning it the title of Most Powerful Amplifier in its class. But power of this stature without equally serious control translates into trouble waiting to happen. That's why Sunfire developed its exclusive Tracking Downconverter TM technology for the coolest, most reliable operation no matter how hot the performance gets.What's more, the TGA-7401 - and its sibling the TGA-7201 - are each Sunfire Optimized TM , a powerful program that ensures your new amp is designed to perform optimally with other Sunfire electronics and our wide assortment of speakers, too. Having said all this, could Sunfire's Amplifiers ever really provide you with too much power? Just turn one up and find out."
