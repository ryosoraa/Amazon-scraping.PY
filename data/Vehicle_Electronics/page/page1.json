The i509-WRA-JK is compatible with the iDatalink Maestro Module (sold separately) allowing select factory features like voice-activated media player, Bluetooth technology, and steering wheel controls to be retained and vehicle information displayed on the screen. The iDatalink can also integrate with the Jeep diagnostic port so select vehicle information like tire pressure, battery voltage, door status, engine codes, and user-customizable gauges can be monitored on the display. Front and rear camera inputs allow you to add a front or rearview camera (sold separately) to the i509-WRA-JK. The rearview camera includes a distance guide display that overlays guidelines onto the screen for ease when moving in reverse. Multiple camera angles can be viewed with the KCX-C2600B Universal Front and Rear Camera Selector (sold separately). Take driving safety even further with the DVR-C320R Premium 1080P Front and Rear Dash Camera with built-in drive assist (sold separately). Integrated tuning features bring out the full potential of music playback with a 5-band graphic EQ or 13-band parametric EQ per channel, for continuous frequency control. The 6-channel time correction capability ensures that music is staged properly in the front and center of the vehicle. If more power is needed, additional amplifiers can be added using the three sets of true 4V preamp outputs with front, rear, and subwoofer control. While the i509-WRA-JK is mech-less (no CD/DVD player) an HDMI input and output are included to allow the user to add a DVD player, or even a smartphone to the head unit for an all-digital audio and video connection through a single cable."
