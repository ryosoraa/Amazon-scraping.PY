You can display echoes in 8, 16, or 64 colors, with color assignment dependent on the strength of the returned echo. The Furuno free synthesizer (ffs) transceiver allows a wide selection of operating frequencies. You may choose any two frequencies between 28 and 200 KHz to fit your fishing operation. Output power is selectable from 1, 2 or 3 kw. A wide variety of display modes and functions are available, which provide skippers with simple and intuitive information. Furuno digital filter optimizes the gain to obtain highly defined images of underwater conditions. The fcv-295 can Clearly Show target Fish close to the seabed. The digital filter also eliminates noise, to deliver sharp and detailed echo presentation, achieving the detection of fishing reefs and even individual Fish with absolute clarity. The rate of transmission is increased by more than 30% compared to conventional Fish finders. As the result, more detailed information about underwater conditions can be gained through the same sounding Interval. With the fcv-295's auto transmission function, the rate is automatically raised in shallow waters and lowered in deep waters, which provides for detailed detection of seabed targets."

From plug-&-play kit solutions, true weatherproof ratings, to factory fit and finishes, SSV has set the standard in UTV audio from the very beginning! Plug-&-Play: No Soldering, cutting or crimping! Designed to install as easy as possible. Simply bolt down the speaker enclosures with the pre-installed speakers, run the vehicle specific plug-&-play wiring, turn the key and go! Made to install as easy as possible, you spend less time wrenching and more time riding! Factory Fit and Finish: Each kit looks just the way it should, like it came straight from the factory. Purpose built, our enclosures match the factory styling and fits with seamless precision. Trail Ready: Built for the off-road environment, SSV Works' audio components will withstand all the harsh riding conditions. From sand, dust, water or snow, you can ride your favorite trails without sacrificing premium audio from SSV Works. Premium Quality: Our kits include our patented Phase EQ amplifier and Rock \u2018N Ride switch to power your new audio kit for your UTV. Phase EQ: When other companies say their amps come pretuned, all they are doing is setting the gains and a few other settings. Our Phase EQ amp comes DSP (Digital Signal Processor) tuned to your specific vehicle and audio-kit you're purchasing. This means the frequencies have been tuned to process your favorite audio to sound the absolute best, no matter your riding style. The way Phase EQ processes the audio is the same as you would find in today's luxury on-road vehicles. Because of this, we can better utilize the power output, allowing Phase EQ to our-preform larger more powerful amplifiers. More watts do not always mean better or louder. Rock \u2018N Ride: Our patented new switch comes with every Phase EQ amplifier. It fits in your standard rocker-switch location and allows you to switch between multiple audio profiles. Ready to hit the trail? select RIDE and the amp will process the audio to compensate for wind and engine noise, as well as boost the frequencies would lose from wearing your helmet, achieving the most energized listening experience in the cab, while riding. Back at camp? Hit ROCK to switch to a profile tuned to sound more optimal outside of the vehicle. This provides the fullest sonic and most optimal sound while you're cracking a cold one by the fire."
