The FCV1150 is a color digital sounder designed for a variety of professional fishing operations. Its high-brightness 12.1' color LCD with AR Coated glass filter provides superior, glare-free viewing even in Direct sunlight. The FCV1150 employs Furuno free synthesizer (ffs) technology which permits a wide selection of operating frequencies from 28 to 200Khz. If a Furuno transducer is used, operating Frequency is automatically set in the menu, and can be shifted Manually at any time. This feature is useful for vessels targeting many different species of Fish, and may also be used to eliminate interference that may be caused by nearby ships with transducers operating at the same Frequency. Output power is selectable among 1, 2 or 3 kw. A wide variety of display modes and functions are available that provide captains with simple and intuitive information for virtually any fishing requirement including single (HF/LF), Dual, single + zoom, zoom (bottom lock, bottom zoom or marker zoom), mix mode, NAV data and a-scope. Additionally, two custom display modes may be programmed by the operator. The FCV1150 incorporates new transmission techniques that automatically switches the echo transmission rate according to the depth of the sounding area. Transmission speed is raised in shallow waters and lowered in deep waters, Providing more detailed detection of seabed and targets. The gain setting for all of the echoes on the screen can be adjusted by rotating the gain knob. Because all of the visible echoes on the screen are adjusted with the gain Settings, the correct setting for virtually any situation can be quickly and easily determined."

The Air Motion Transformer (AMT) represents a loudspeaker concept that does not require a classic voice coil.On a thin Kapton foil (12 - 25 \u00b5m thick), a specially designed conductor track made of thin aluminum (also only 12 - 25 \u00b5m thick) is worked out via complex etching processes, which has a meandering course.To achieve high manufacturing precision, the foil is folded by hand using special tools. Unlike conventional tweeter domes, the folded AMT diaphragm in the loudspeaker does not make any movement from the front and to the rear to produce the tones. The movement takes place in the folds, that is, laterally, similar to a bellows. This causes the air in the convolutions to accelerate and exit the front.One advantage of this technology is that the diaphragm area is larger than the visible area and thus takes up less space.Coupled with the light weight of the diaphragm, this results in a detailed and dynamic reproduction.All housing parts are elaborately CNC machined, nickel plated, powder coated and then laser engraved. The aluminum frame can be dismantled to allow an even more compact installation. The special copper cable with silicone sheathing and braid protection is directly connected to the membrane to avoid unnecessary transitions or materials in the signal path.
