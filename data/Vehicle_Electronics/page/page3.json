Rock \u2018N Ride: Our patented new switch comes with every Phase EQ amplifier. It fits in your standard rocker-switch location and allows you to switch between multiple audio profiles. Ready to hit the trail? select RIDE and the amp will process the audio to compensate for wind and engine noise, as well as boost the frequencies would lose from wearing your helmet, achieving the most energized listening experience in the cab, while riding.
