        "product_descriptions": "Music fans who attend live concerts know well the emotions that low undistorted frequencies without dynamic compression can arouse. For this reason, the HertzAudioVideo R&D created ML 2500.3 Legend car audio subwoofer. During the long development phase, the designers set themselves just one ambitious goal: to transfer the emotions of a live performance to the car environment. Thanks to a completely renewed design, ML2500.3 car audio subwoofers have extremely compact size and are optimized to play in enclosures with reduced boxes. This choice of design combines two requirements hard to achieve up to now: reference performance and ease of installation. Features - Exponential V-cone with optimized geometry for high cone stiffness and strong resistance to deformation even at maximum excursions. Mineral-injected paper cone, for superior rigidity and damping. Very acoustically transparent anti-resonant aluminium alloy basket featuring six-spoke self-standing structure and built-in venting holes underneath the spider. CNC machined elegant diamond-cut basket edge featuring the Hertz logo. Ergonomic, ultra-compact design, with array of electro-acoustic parameters optimized for sealed box application with 17 - 25 lt volume. Specifications - Size mm (in.): 250 (10) Power Handling - Peak W: 1400 Power Handling - Continuous W: 700 Impedance W: 4 Frequency response Hz: 27 \u00f7 500 Sensitivity dB SPL: 88"
