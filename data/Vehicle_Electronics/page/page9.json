        "product_descriptions": "The Hertz MLK 1650.3 Legend car audio speakers system is a two way kit dedicated to purists , aiming at achieving maximum timbre consistency combined with very high dynamics and extremely extended frequency response. Through a solidly built switch, the MLCX 2 TW.3 crossover provides the ability to realize a bi-amplified system, that is, to connect two amplifiers, or anyway two separate channels, to the crossover, so making it possible to drive woofer and tweeter separately. The significant power increase with this configuration highlights all the features of the MLK 1650.3 Legend system, with all the advantages coming from the multi-amplification. Besides, thanks to the Mid-Contour and Hi-Countor controls, dedicated to the management of woofer cut-off frequency and tweeter cut-off frequency respectively, the cross-point can be varied. Through each of these two Countor controls, featuring a two-position selector, the system frequency response can be fine-tuned, adjusting it according to the different acoustics of the cars and the different speaker placements and, most of all, the listener can achieve thieir favourite sound. Features - Tetolon Fiber dome optimized with FEA simulations for lower distortion and improved dispersion in high frequency range. Exponential V-cone with optimized geometry for utmost linearity and dispersion at mid frequency range. Bi-amplification available, selectable through appropriate hi-current rating switch with hi-current carrying capability.
