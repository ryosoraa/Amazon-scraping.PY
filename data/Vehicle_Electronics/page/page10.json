The transducer system has a built-in attitude and heading reference system (AHRS) that stabilizes the sonar imagery, automatically compensating for vessel motion. You'll enjoy crystal-clear imagery in waves, swells, and while maneuvering. The RV-212 system also has a built-in fast response water temperature sensor for quick, accurate readings. Raymarine's RV-212 Bronze Through Hull Transducer system pack contains a pair of RealVision 3D transducers with internal offset to accommodate hull deadrise angles from 1 to 12. This completely eliminates the need for fairing blocks. The low-profile design slips effortlessly through the water without causing drag or cavitation. The near-flush RV-212 system works great on trailered boats too. The RV-212 system features rugged cast-bronze through hull bodies suitable for fiberglass or wooden hulls. One transducer transmits and receives to port and downwards, the other to starboard and downwards, ensuring a full 180 of underwater coverage even on boats with deep keels or other underwater protrusions. Each transducer features a 2-meter pigtail, joining y-cable and 8-meter extension cable, resulting in an overall cable length of 10 meters (33 feet.)"

Power up If you like your music loud and clear, Rockford Fosgate designed their Power Series T-4652-S 6-1/2' component system for you. These speakers can handle up to 150 watts RMS, which means you can crank this system for hours without a worry. The woofer features a cone made from woven Liquid Crystal Polymer fibers, with a special-design butyl rubber surround that gives you more cone area without increasing the size of the basket. Translation? You'll hear deeper, richer lows than you would from most speakers of this size. The 1' LCP fiber ring radiator tweeter features an aluminum phase plug to give high notes the perfect sparkle in your car. Rockford Fosgate uses superior components to create a crossover network that eliminates the 'hot spots' and dropouts caused by inferior crossovers. You'll find a nice selection of customization options, including three selectable tweeter levels, selectable bi-amp switching, and on/off axis settings. Easier installation Rockford Fosgate has simplified installation on all fronts. FlexFit slot woofer mounting makes it easier to install these speakers in case the factory holes are slightly off. And Discreet Dual Clamp tweeter mounting hardware makes it easier to install your tweeters in flush-mount applications. All told, this Power Series system will enhance your driving experience for years to come. Installation note: You'll need a pair of our universal backstraps to install the tweeters in the factory locations."
