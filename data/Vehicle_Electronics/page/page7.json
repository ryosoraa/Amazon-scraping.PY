From sand, dust, water or snow, you can ride your favorite trails without sacrificing premium audio from SSV Works. Premium Quality: Our kits include our patented Phase EQ amplifier and Rock \u2018N Ride switch to power your new audio kit for your UTV. Phase EQ: When other companies say their amps come pretuned, all they are doing is setting the gains and a few other settings. Our Phase EQ amp comes DSP (Digital Signal Processor) tuned to your specific vehicle and audio-kit you're purchasing. This means the frequencies have been tuned to process your favorite audio to sound the absolute best, no matter your riding style. The way Phase EQ processes the audio is the same as you would find in today's luxury on-road vehicles. Because of this, we can better utilize the power output, allowing Phase EQ to our-preform larger more powerful amplifiers. More watts do not always mean better or louder. Rock \u2018N Ride: Our patented new switch comes with every Phase EQ amplifier. It fits in your standard rocker-switch location and allows you to switch between multiple audio profiles. Ready to hit the trail? select RIDE and the amp will process the audio to compensate for wind and engine noise, as well as boost the frequencies would lose from wearing your helmet, achieving the most energized listening experience in the cab, while riding. Back at camp? Hit ROCK to switch to a profile tuned to sound more optimal outside of the vehicle. This provides the fullest sonic and most optimal sound while you're cracking a cold one by the fire."
