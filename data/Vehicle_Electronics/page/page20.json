Engineered for performance, it incorporates state-of-the-art circuit optimization for a high-current, half-bridge amp with a surprisingly small footprint that allows for 2 wide installation in many of todays popular SPL/DEMO vehicles.",
          "The Z12's chassis features DD Audio's exclusive High Volume Air Circulation (HVAC) heat management system. The mass of the heavy-duty extruded aluminum heatsink coupled with intelligent fin design constantly transfers heat to the outside air while an internal brushless fan pulls in cooler air through an elevated bottom panel and end panel vents to maximize air flow over hard working internal components.",
          "Its also ready to connect to the DD Audio ZVL module, giving it the flexibility to easily integrate into multi amp systems to drive the most punishing of subwoofer stages."
