  "product_descriptions": "Canon's all-new 45 Megapixel full-frame sensor is at the heart of the EOS R5's superb image quality, which also leads the way for impressive8K DCI cinematic movie capture with the ability to extract 35.4 Megapixel still images. Focus and speed are paramount in the EOS R5, providingimpressive continuous capture at speeds of up to 20 frames-per-second and with Dual Pixel CMOS AF II capability, to track split secondmovements of even the most elusive of subjects. With 1,053 Automatic AF zones, it is easier than ever to photograph people with the use ofEye, Face and Head Detection AF, or intuitively track the whole body, face or eye of cats, dogs, or birds with Animal Detection AF. The 5-axisin-body image stabilization can effectively compensate for camera shake with approximately 8 stops of stabilization with use of both non-stabilized,and optically image stabilized lenses. Connectivity like 5GHz and 2.4GHz Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, is also included."
